# [Your Consultancy] Remodeler Playbook (Docusaurus v3)

Docs-only Docusaurus site with autogenerated sidebar, light mode only, and [Your Consultancy] branding (navbar title + favicon).

## Requirements
- Node 18+
- npm

## Install
```bash
npm install
```

## Local dev
```bash
npm start
```
- Opens http://localhost:3000
- Site is served at the root: http://localhost:3000/

## Build
```bash
npm run build
```
Outputs static assets to `build/`.

## Validation (broken links & duplicate IDs)
- `npm run validate` — fast checks for duplicate doc IDs, missing frontmatter, and broken internal links.
- `npm run check` — validate + full production build.
- Pre-commit hook runs `npm run validate` automatically (via Husky). If it fails, fix reported links/IDs before committing.

### How broken links are detected
- Only internal relative links (`./` or `../`) are validated.
- Links with hashes are resolved without the hash and must point to an existing file (`.md`/`.mdx`).
- Each doc must start with frontmatter. Missing frontmatter fails validation.

### Duplicate ID detection
- IDs come from frontmatter `id:`; if absent, the filename (without extension) is used.
- Duplicate IDs across docs fail validation. Rename the file or set a unique `id:` in frontmatter.

## Preview build locally
```bash
npm run serve
```
Serves the production build (defaults to http://localhost:3000).

## Deployment (Vercel)
- Build Command: `npm run build`
- Output Directory: `build`
- Site assumes `baseUrl = /`
- If hosting at `https://playbook.[Your Consultancy].build/`, no subpath rewrite is needed—just point the domain to this Vercel project.

## Notes
- Docs live at the site root via `routeBasePath: '/'`.
- Sidebar auto-generates from `docs/`.
- No blog or edit links are enabled.
- Navbar title uses the South Korea Serif font served from `static/fonts/`.
