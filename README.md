# [PROJECT TITLE] (Docusaurus v3)

Docs-only Docusaurus site with autogenerated sidebar, light mode only.

## Requirements
- Node 20+ (see `package.json` engines)

## Install
```bash
npm install
```

## Local dev
```bash
npm start
```
- Opens http://localhost:3000
- Site is served at the root: http://localhost:3000/

## Build
```bash
npm run build
```
Outputs static assets to `build/`.

## Validation (broken links & duplicate IDs)
- `npm run validate` — fast checks for duplicate doc IDs, missing frontmatter, and broken internal links.
- `npm run check` — validate + full production build.
- Pre-commit hook runs `npm run validate` automatically (via Husky). If it fails, fix reported links/IDs before committing.

### How broken links are detected
- Only internal relative links (`./` or `../`) are validated.
- Links with hashes are resolved without the hash and must point to an existing file (`.md`/`.mdx`).
- Each doc must start with frontmatter. Missing frontmatter fails validation.

### Duplicate ID detection
- IDs come from frontmatter `id:`; if absent, the filename (without extension) is used.
- Duplicate IDs across docs fail validation. Rename the file or set a unique `id:` in frontmatter.

## Preview build locally
```bash
npm run serve
```
Serves the production build (defaults to http://localhost:3000).

## Deployment

### Before deploying:
1. Update `docusaurus.config.js`:
   - Set `url` to your production domain
   - Set `title` and `tagline` to your project name
   - Update `organizationName` and `projectName` if using GitHub Pages
   - Update `favicon` path if needed

### Deployment options:

**Vercel:**
- Build Command: `npm run build`
- Output Directory: `build`
- Site assumes `baseUrl = /`
- Point your domain to the Vercel project

**Other platforms:**
- Build the site with `npm run build`
- Deploy the `build/` directory to your hosting provider
- Ensure the site is served at the root path (or update `baseUrl` accordingly)

## Notes
- Docs live at the site root via `routeBasePath: '/'`.
- Sidebar auto-generates from `docs/`.
- No blog or edit links are enabled.
