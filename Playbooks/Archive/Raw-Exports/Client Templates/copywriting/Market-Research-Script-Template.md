# Market Research Script Template - With Source Context & Personal Commentary

**Purpose**: Create engaging market research presentations that lead with source credibility, include personal insights, and present balanced strategic recommendations.

## Core Market Research Script Framework

### 1. Research Presentation Script Generator

```
You are creating a market research presentation script that builds trust through transparency about data sources and includes authentic personal commentary. 

Create a research presentation script for: [TOPIC/INDUSTRY]

**Input Requirements:**
- Research Topic: [INSERT]
- Target Audience: [Builder size/type]
- Key Findings: [Main insights]
- Time Length: [Minutes]
- Presentation Format: [Video/Webinar/Screenshare]

**Script Structure with Source Context:**

**INTRODUCTION WITH SOURCE OVERVIEW (0-90 seconds):**
- Hook with surprising stat
- "Before we dive in, let me tell you where this data comes from..."
- Overview of main sources and why they matter
- Personal take: "What caught my attention about this research..."

**SOURCE CREDIBILITY SECTION (90-180 seconds):**
For each major source:
- Who conducted the research
- When it was collected (emphasize recency)
- Sample size and demographics
- Geographic scope
- Industry focus (general vs construction-specific)
- Personal impression: "What I like about [Source] is..." or "One thing to note about this data..."

Example:
"So Promodo surveyed 500 marketing directors across B2B companies in Q1 2025. Now, this isn't construction-specific, but here's why it matters to you - about 30% of their sample was from similar high-ticket, long sales cycle industries. What I appreciate about Promodo is they break down their data by company size, so we can look at what's working for companies in your revenue range."

**KEY FINDINGS WITH CONTEXT (3-8 minutes):**
For each major finding:
- Present the data point
- Explain the source and methodology
- Add personal commentary/reaction
- Relate to construction industry
- Frame as part of balanced strategy

Template:
"[Data point] according to [Source]'s study of [sample description]. 
[Personal reaction]: 'This actually surprised me because...' or 'This matches what I'm seeing with my builder clients...'
For builders, this means [specific application].
But remember, this is just one piece of your overall marketing strategy..."

**BALANCED STRATEGY RECOMMENDATIONS (2-3 minutes):**
- Frame specific tactics within comprehensive approach
- Avoid over-promoting any single channel
- Include reality checks

Example:
"Yes, LinkedIn is showing strong engagement rates, but it's not a magic bullet. It works best when it's part of a balanced approach that includes [other tactics]. Think of it as your professional networking arm, not your entire marketing strategy."

**REGIONAL/INDUSTRY ADJUSTMENTS (1-2 minutes):**
- How to adjust general data for construction
- Regional market variations
- Size/specialty considerations
- Personal insights from working with builders

**CLOSING WITH SOURCE SUMMARY (30-60 seconds):**
- Recap main sources used
- Where to find more information
- Invitation for questions about methodology
- Personal availability for deeper discussion

**SOURCE CITATION FORMAT IN SCRIPT:**
Natural integration: "According to HubSpot's 2025 State of Marketing report - and by the way, they surveyed over 1,400 marketers globally for this..."
Personal color: "I've been following DoYouConvert for years because they focus specifically on conversion optimization, not just traffic..."

**Personal Commentary Examples:**
- "This number seemed high to me at first, but when you dig into their methodology..."
- "What's interesting about Salesforce's data is they can track actual ROI, not just engagement..."
- "I was skeptical about this until I saw it working with three of my builder clients..."
- "The sample size here is smaller than I'd like, but the trend is consistent with..."
```

### 2. Source Context Introduction Templates

```
**Opening Source Context Scripts:**

**Version A - Research Compilation:**
"So I've pulled together data from five different sources for today's review. Let me quickly tell you who they are and why I trust them. First up is [Source 1] - they've been tracking [specific metric] for over [years], and what I like about them is [specific strength]. They surveyed [number] companies, mostly [size/type], which gives us good insight into [relevance]..."

**Version B - Single Major Study:**
"This entire presentation is based on [Source]'s comprehensive study of [topic]. Before we dive into the numbers, here's why this data matters: They surveyed [number] [target audience] between [dates], specifically looking at [focus areas]. What makes this particularly relevant for builders is [connection]..."

**Version C - Mixed Sources:**
"I'm combining three types of data today - industry research from [Source 1], our own client results, and some broader marketing trends from [Source 2]. Each source has its strengths and limitations, which I'll point out as we go. This gives us a more complete picture than any single study could provide..."
```

### 3. Personal Commentary Integration

```
**Commentary Insertion Points:**

**After Presenting Key Stats:**
"Now, when I first saw this 47% increase, I thought it had to be wrong. But then I checked with five of my builder clients, and four of them saw similar jumps. Here's what I think is happening..."

**When Introducing Sources:**
"I've been reading Bokka Group's research for about three years now. They tend to focus on enterprise-level data, so for Design-Build Remodeler, you might see numbers about 20% lower, but the trends hold true..."

**During Methodology Explanation:**
"They surveyed CMOs from companies doing $10M to $500M. Obviously that's a huge range, but they break it down by revenue tiers. For builders in the $10M-50M range - which is most of you watching - here's what matters..."

**Reality Check Moments:**
"Look, I know some of you are thinking 'That's great for software companies, but construction is different.' You're right. In my experience, these numbers need about a 6-month lag for our industry..."

**Surprise Reactions:**
"This next stat honestly shocked me. Email marketing showing a 4200% ROI? I was skeptical until I dug into how they calculated it. Turns out they're including lifetime value, not just immediate conversions..."
```

### 4. Balanced Strategy Framing

```
**Avoiding Single-Channel Promotion:**

Instead of: "LinkedIn is the best platform for builders!"
Use: "LinkedIn is showing strong results as PART of a multi-channel approach. It works best when you're also doing [other tactics] because LinkedIn helps with [specific role] while your other channels handle [other roles]..."

**Context Within Bigger Picture:**
"These email marketing stats are impressive, but remember - email is your nurturing tool, not your discovery tool. You still need [other channels] to fill the top of your funnel. Email just helps you convert those leads more effectively..."

**Reality-Based Recommendations:**
"Yes, the data shows video content getting 1200% more shares. But before you hire a video team, consider this: for most builders, one quality video per quarter combined with consistent photo posts will outperform daily video attempts..."
```

## Usage Notes

1. **Always Lead with Context**: Never present data without first explaining where it came from
2. **Personal Touch**: Include authentic reactions and connections to real client experiences  
3. **Balanced Perspective**: Frame every tactic as part of a larger strategy
4. **Transparency**: Be honest about data limitations and industry adjustments needed
5. **Conversational Tone**: Write for speaking, not reading - include natural speech patterns

## Source Commentary Best Practices

- Share why you trust (or question) specific sources
- Mention how long you've been following their research
- Note any biases or limitations honestly
- Connect methodology to relevance for builders
- Add personal anecdotes when relevant
- Express genuine surprise or validation when appropriate

Remember: The goal is to build trust through transparency while making complex data accessible and actionable for busy builders.
