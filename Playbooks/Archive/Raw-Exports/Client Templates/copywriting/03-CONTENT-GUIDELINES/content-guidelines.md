# Effective Human-Sounding Copywriting Guidelines for AI

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for crafting prompts that lead to natural, human-sounding copywriting across various content types and channels. The focus is on strategies to mirror individual voices and optimize AI output for specific use-cases, rather than providing specific prompts.

## Core Principles for Human-Sounding AI Output

To achieve the most natural and effective results from AI copywriting, consider these overarching principles:

*   **Establish a Clear Persona for the AI:** Instruct the AI to adopt a specific role or persona (e.g., "Act as a seasoned marketing expert," "You are a witty social media manager"). This helps the model maintain a consistent tone, voice, and perspective, making the output feel more authentic.

*   **Provide Rich Context and Scenarios:** Frame your requests within real-world situations or specific problems. Instead of generic instructions, describe the scenario, the target audience, and the desired outcome. This encourages the AI to generate nuanced and contextually appropriate responses.

*   **Emphasize Emotion and Empathy:** Guide the AI to understand and evoke specific emotions or to connect with the target audience's feelings. Prompts that focus on the emotional impact or the user's pain points tend to produce more relatable and persuasive content.

*   **Define Tone and Style Explicitly:** Clearly state the desired tone (e.g., "witty," "persuasive," "professional and motivational," "warm," "conversational") and stylistic elements (e.g., "narrative-rich," "hook-first structure," "avoid jargon," "use short sentences").

*   **Incorporate Brand Voice and Personality:** If possible, provide examples of your existing content or describe your brand's unique voice and personality. Instruct the AI to "mirror my brand's playful tone" or "incorporate our company's core values." This is crucial for consistent and authentic brand communication.

*   **Utilize Constraints and Exclusions:** Specify what the AI should *not* do (e.g., "do not use clichés," "avoid overly formal language," "never say 'here's the deal'," "avoid question-answer patterns like 'Solution? Solution.'," "don't use inflammatory language like 'drives me crazy'," "never create fake case studies or made-up examples - only use real, verified client stories"). This helps refine the output and prevent common AI-generated patterns.

*   **Provide Real-world Examples and Analogies:** Offer examples of desired output or use analogies (e.g., "write it like a seasoned journalist") to guide the AI toward a more human-like style.

*   **Implement Iterative Refinement:** Treat AI generation as a collaborative process. Start with a broader prompt and then use follow-up prompts to fine-tune the output based on your review. This continuous feedback loop helps train the AI to better understand and replicate your desired voice and style.

## SOURCE CITATION REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL CONTENT

**Essential for Credibility and Verification:**

*   **Always include sources when presenting data, statistics, or research findings** - This applies to all content formats: videos, blogs, social posts, emails, etc.

*   **Cite sources naturally within the content** - Work citations seamlessly into the narrative (e.g., "according to Promodo's 2024 report," "HubSpot's latest research shows," "data from the Content Marketing Institute reveals")

*   **Include a sources section in all content documents** - List complete references at the end of scripts, blog posts, and other content pieces

*   **For video content, mention key sources during the presentation for credibility** - Don't rely solely on description links; build trust by citing sources verbally

*   **When using research documents, pull the original source citations from the research rather than citing the research document itself** - Always trace back to the primary source

*   **Example citation formats:**
    - **In content:** "According to Salesforce's 2024 State of Marketing report..."
    - **Sources section:** "Salesforce. (2024). State of Marketing Report. Retrieved from [URL]"
    - **Visual cue:** [SCREEN: Show report graphic with "Source: Salesforce 2024" overlay]

*   **Benefits of proper citation:**
    - Builds credibility and trust with audience
    - Allows viewers/readers to verify information independently
    - Demonstrates thorough research and professionalism
    - Protects against misinformation claims
    - Enhances SEO value through authoritative references

## Guidelines by Content Type and Channel

### Short-Form Thought Leadership Video Scripts (90–108 sec, vertical format)

**Channels:** Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, YouTube Shorts

**Key Requirements:** Clear, interesting hooks, 1–2 learning moments, CTA or opinion when appropriate, **proper source citation**

**Prompting Guidelines:**

*   **Structure:** Clearly define the video's structure: "Start with a clear, interesting hook that opens the topic, introduce 1-2 key learning moments, and conclude with a call to action or strong opinion when appropriate." Specify time allocations if possible (e.g., "Hook: 5-10 sec, Learning Moment 1: 30 sec, Learning Moment 2: 30 sec, CTA/Opinion: 10-15 sec"). Avoid formal section headers - let content flow naturally.
*   **Hook Intensity:** Match hook intensity to content intensity. When the idea is already extreme or contrarian, favor understated, grounded hooks over big promises or dramatic claims. Hooks should be interesting, specific, and honest—not theatrical or manufactured for shock value.

*   **Engagement:** Emphasize the need for dynamic language. Use action verbs and direct address to the viewer. Instruct the AI to "write in a conversational, energetic tone suitable for vertical video." Use connectors ("and", "but", "or") to create flow between ideas instead of choppy, separate sentences.

*   **Value Delivery:** For learning moments, instruct the AI to "break down complex ideas into easily digestible points" and "provide actionable insights." Focus on specific examples and steps rather than abstract concepts.

*   **Call to Action/Opinion:** When appropriate, include a clear and concise CTA. For opinions, instruct the AI to "present a thoughtful, grounded stance" that encourages discussion. Not every piece needs a hard call-to-action; some content can simply clarify or reframe thinking. Consider ending with gratitude ("Thanks for watching") rather than challenge-based CTAs.

*   **Language to Avoid:** Instruct the AI to avoid inflammatory language ("drives me crazy"), question-answer patterns ("Problem? Solution."), and overused phrases ("Here's the deal"). Keep language observational rather than overly emotional.

*   **Source Integration:** When presenting data or statistics, instruct the AI to "naturally cite sources within the spoken content and include visual source callouts."

*   **Visual Cues (Implicit):** While the AI generates text, consider adding notes for visual elements: "(Visual: show product in use)" or "(Visual: text overlay of key statistic)" to guide the script's visual potential.

**Example Prompt Structure:**
"You are a thought leader creating a 90-second vertical video script for [Channel, e.g., Instagram Reels] about [Topic]. The script needs a clear, interesting hook, two distinct learning moments, and a call to action when appropriate. Match hook intensity to topic intensity—if the idea is already sharp, use a grounded, understated hook. Write in a [Tone, e.g., inspiring, direct, conversational] voice. 

**Hook:** [Brief description of desired hook, e.g., a surprising statistic or a relatable problem]
**Learning Moment 1:** [Key takeaway 1]
**Learning Moment 2:** [Key takeaway 2]
**Call to Action/Opinion:** [Desired action or strong opinion]

Include proper source citations for any data or statistics mentioned. Ensure the language is concise and impactful for a fast-paced vertical format."

### Short-Form Status Updates (Image + Text)

**Channels:** Instagram, Facebook, Twitter/X, LinkedIn

**Key Requirements:** Simple contextual captions with channel-aware tone, **source attribution when relevant**

**Prompting Guidelines:**

*   **Brevity and Impact:** Instruct the AI to be concise. "Write a short, punchy caption." For Twitter/X, explicitly mention character limits if relevant.

*   **Contextualization:** Provide details about the accompanying image. "The image shows [description of image]." This helps the AI create a caption that truly complements the visual.

*   **Channel-Aware Tone:** Specify the tone for each platform. For Instagram, "use a friendly, engaging tone with relevant emojis." For LinkedIn, "maintain a professional yet approachable tone, focusing on insights or industry relevance." For Twitter/X, "aim for witty, concise, and shareable language."

*   **Source Attribution:** If sharing data, insights, or statistics, instruct the AI to "include source attribution in a natural, platform-appropriate way."

*   **Hashtags:** Request relevant hashtags. "Suggest 3-5 relevant and trending hashtags." For Instagram, "include a mix of broad and niche hashtags."

**Example Prompt Structure:**
"Generate a short status update caption for [Channel, e.g., LinkedIn]. The post is accompanied by an image of [Image Description]. The caption should be [Tone, e.g., informative, inspiring, lighthearted] and provide [Context/Purpose, e.g., a quick tip, a thought on a recent event]. If sharing data or insights, include appropriate source attribution. Include relevant hashtags."

### Long-Form Video / Scripted Video Content

**Channels:** YouTube, Blog, LinkedIn

**Key Requirements:** Value-driven, narrative-rich, visual-ready scripts with intro/body/conclusion structure, **comprehensive source documentation**

**Prompting Guidelines:**

*   **Detailed Structure:** Clearly outline the desired sections: "Write a script with a compelling introduction, a detailed body with multiple sub-sections, and a strong conclusion." Specify the purpose of each section. Avoid formal section labels - let the content flow naturally from topic to topic.

*   **Narrative Flow:** Instruct the AI to "weave a narrative throughout the script" and "ensure smooth transitions between points." Emphasize storytelling elements. Use connectors and transitional phrases to link ideas rather than abrupt topic changes.

*   **Value Proposition:** For each section, define the value to the audience. "The introduction should hook the viewer by [method]. Each body section should deliver [specific value/learning]." 

*   **Visual Readiness:** Encourage the AI to suggest visual cues within the script. "Include parenthetical notes for potential visuals or on-screen text." (e.g., "[VISUAL: Infographic showing data trends]").

*   **Language Guidelines:** Avoid inflammatory expressions, question-answer patterns, and overused transitions like "Here's the deal." Keep language conversational and observational.

*   **Source Integration:** Instruct the AI to "seamlessly integrate source citations throughout the script and compile a comprehensive sources section at the end."

*   **Depth and Detail:** For long-form content, emphasize thoroughness. "Provide in-depth explanations and examples for each point." Focus on actionable, specific content over abstract concepts. 

**Example Prompt Structure:**
"You are a content creator developing a long-form video script for [Channel, e.g., YouTube] on [Topic]. The script should be value-driven, narrative-rich, and include visual cues. Structure it with an Introduction, 3-4 Body Sections, and a Conclusion. 

**Introduction:** [Goal of intro, e.g., hook audience, state problem]
**Body Section 1:** [Key point 1, value delivered]
**Body Section 2:** [Key point 2, value delivered]
**Body Section 3:** [Key point 3, value delivered]
**Conclusion:** [Summarize, call to action, next steps]

Include proper source citations for all data, statistics, and research findings mentioned. Maintain a [Tone, e.g., educational, engaging, authoritative] voice throughout. Ensure smooth transitions and suggest visuals where appropriate."

### Text-Only Thought Posts / Insight Threads

**Channels:** LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Blog

**Key Requirements:** Hook-first structure, clear formatting, topical expertise, **source credibility**

**Prompting Guidelines:**

*   **Hook-First:** Explicitly demand a clear, interesting opening. "Start with a hook that opens the topic in an interesting, specific way." Match hook intensity to content intensity—when ideas are already sharp or contrarian, favor grounded hooks over dramatic claims. The body should feel calmer and more explanatory than the hook, not like a string of hooks. 

*   **Clear Formatting:** Instruct the AI on formatting for readability: "Use short paragraphs, bullet points, and bold text for key takeaways." For threads, specify how each post should be structured and linked.

*   **Topical Expertise:** If the AI needs to sound like an expert, provide it with background information or instruct it to "adopt the persona of a seasoned expert in [field]." 

*   **Insight-Driven:** Emphasize the need for original insights or unique perspectives. "Go beyond surface-level information and provide a fresh take on [topic]." 

*   **Source Authority:** Instruct the AI to "support key points with credible sources and include them naturally in the content flow."

*   **Engagement (for threads):** For Twitter/X threads, instruct the AI to "build anticipation with each tweet" and "encourage replies and discussion."
*   **Reflective Content:** Not every piece needs to be action-oriented. Some content can simply clarify, reframe thinking, or explore ideas without forcing a call-to-action or list of steps. 

**Example Prompt Structure:**
"Write a text-only thought post/insight thread for [Channel, e.g., LinkedIn] on [Topic]. The post should have a hook-first structure, be clearly formatted for readability, and demonstrate topical expertise. Adopt a [Tone, e.g., insightful, analytical, thought-provoking] voice. 

**Hook:** [Idea for the opening hook]
**Main Points:** [List 3-5 key insights or arguments]
**Call to Action/Question:** [Encourage engagement or discussion]

Include credible sources to support key points and ensure concise language and effective use of formatting (e.g., short paragraphs, bullet points, bolding)."

### Automated Newsletter/Email Digest

**Channels:** Email, Blog, LinkedIn

**Key Requirements:** Summarized highlights, warm tone, mobile-first design, **source transparency**

**Prompting Guidelines:**

*   **Summarization:** Instruct the AI to "summarize key highlights from [source content, e.g., recent blog posts, news articles] into digestible snippets." 

*   **Warm Tone:** Emphasize a friendly, approachable, and warm tone. "Write in a conversational and welcoming voice, as if speaking directly to a friend." 

*   **Mobile-First Design (Implicit):** While AI generates text, the prompt can guide it towards mobile-friendly output. "Keep paragraphs short and use clear headings for easy scanning on mobile devices." "Avoid overly complex sentences." 

*   **Source Transparency:** Instruct the AI to "clearly attribute all content sources and include links to original articles for further reading."

*   **Personalization:** If applicable, instruct the AI to incorporate personalized elements. "Address the reader directly and reference their interests if possible." 

*   **Clear CTAs:** Ensure each summarized highlight has a clear, concise call to action (e.g., "Read More," "Learn More").

**Example Prompt Structure:**
"Generate an automated newsletter/email digest for [Audience]. The digest should summarize the following [Number] highlights from [Source Content, e.g., our latest blog posts]. Write in a warm, friendly, and concise tone, optimized for mobile reading. 

**Highlight 1:** [Brief description of content 1]
**Highlight 2:** [Brief description of content 2]
**Highlight 3:** [Brief description of content 3]

Include clear source attribution for each highlight and a clear call to action. Conclude with a warm closing."

## How Creators Instruct AI to Mirror Voice, Personality, and Frameworks

To ensure AI output truly reflects a unique voice and personality, creators employ several advanced prompting techniques:

1.  **Detailed Persona Descriptions:** Beyond simple roles, creators provide rich, multi-faceted descriptions of the persona the AI should embody. This includes not just job titles but also personality traits, communication style, values, and even quirks. For example: "You are a quirky, insightful tech blogger who explains complex concepts with humor and relatable analogies, always ending with a slightly provocative question."

2.  **Providing Examples of Existing Content (Few-Shot Learning):** This is one of the most effective methods. Creators feed the AI several examples of their own writing or content that perfectly embodies their desired voice. The prompt then instructs the AI to "analyze the style, tone, and structure of the following examples and generate new content in a similar manner." The more diverse and representative the examples, the better the AI's understanding.

3.  **Explicit Style Guides and Brand Kits:** Some creators formalize their voice and personality into a mini-style guide or brand kit. This document, or key excerpts from it, can be included in the prompt. It might detail preferred vocabulary, sentence length, use of contractions, specific jargon to use or avoid, and overall brand messaging.

4.  **Framework Integration and Adaptation:** Instead of just asking for a blog post, creators might specify: "Apply the AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) framework to this product description." Or, for a thought leadership piece: "Structure this argument using the Problem-Agitate-Solve (PAS) framework, ensuring each section builds logically." This provides a robust scaffolding for the AI's creativity.

5.  **Iterative Feedback and Refinement Loops:** This is a continuous process. After receiving initial output, creators provide specific feedback: "This is too formal; make it more conversational and add more personal anecdotes." Or, "The hook isn't strong enough; make it more surprising and less generic." This iterative dialogue helps the AI learn and adapt to the nuances of the desired voice over time.

6.  **Defining "Anti-Patterns":** Just as important as defining what *to* do is defining what *not* to do. Creators might include instructions like: "Avoid corporate jargon," "Do not use passive voice," "Steer clear of clichés like 'synergy' or 'paradigm shift'." This helps eliminate common AI-generated phrases that can make content sound robotic.

By combining these strategies, creators can move beyond generic AI output and achieve highly personalized, human-sounding copywriting that truly reflects their unique brand and message.
