# The Revenue Team Model

**Owner:** MM (Fractional CMO)  
**Key Participants:** RJ (Project Development Director), SE (Content/SEO)

---

## Core Concept

> "A Revenue Team brings together marketing, sales, and leadership to work toward one mission: making your brand the most known and trusted in your market."  
> — Marcus Sheridan, *Endless Customers*

**The shift:** Marketing and sales share ownership of the entire buyer's journey with shared goals, shared data, and coordinated handoffs.

**Marketing's job:** Make sales look great, sound great, and win more deals  
**Sales' job:** Share buyer questions and objections weekly to inform content

## How It Operates

### Bi-Weekly Revenue Team Meeting

**Attendees:** MM, RJ, SE  
**Duration:** 60-90 min

**Standing Agenda:**
1. Buyer questions & objections (RJ shares → informs content)
2. Content performance review (what's working in Assignment Selling?)
3. Editorial calendar planning
4. Pipeline & conversion review
5. Marketing metrics update
6. Alignment action items

**Tool:** [Revenue Team Meeting Agenda Template](../templates/getting-started/revenue-team-meeting-agenda.md)

### Shared Metrics

Both teams measured on:
- Total qualified leads
- Lead-to-close conversion rate
- Average deal size
- Customer lifetime value (referrals, repeat)
- Cost per acquisition

### Key Integration: Assignment Selling

| Element | Owner | Support |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Sales process definition | RJ | MM |
| Content-to-stage mapping | MM | RJ, SE |
| Content library organization | SE | RJ feedback |
| Tracking & measurement | MM | RJ data |

**See:** [Assignment Selling](../07-sales-enablement/assignment-selling.md) for full framework

## Why It Works

**Traditional silos:**
- Marketing and sales blame each other for poor results
- No shared ownership of buyer journey
- Inconsistent messaging from marketing to sales

**Revenue Team:**
- Shared accountability for revenue
- Content addresses real buyer questions (sales provides intel)
- Seamless experience from first touch to close
- Clear attribution and performance tracking

**Sheridan's data:** Prospects who engage with 30+ pages close at 80% vs. 25% for those who don't
