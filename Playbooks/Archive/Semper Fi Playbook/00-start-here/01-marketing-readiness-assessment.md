# Marketing Readiness Assessment

Score each item: **0 = not in place**, **1 = partial**, **2 = solid**. Add quick notes on gaps. Pick the lowest areas as your starting point.

## Foundations
- [ ] Clear positioning statement that the team uses
- [ ] Ideal projects, budgets, and locations defined
- [ ] Simple offer and pricing logic documented
- [ ] One owner for marketing decisions and follow-through

## Trust and Relationships
- [ ] Referral process with asks built into project milestones
- [ ] Active partner list (architects, designers, suppliers) with touchpoints
- [ ] Past client reactivation list tagged and reachable
- [ ] Client experience checklist for handoffs, updates, and after-care

## Digital Presence
- [ ] Website loads quickly and makes it obvious what you do, where, and for whom
- [ ] Clear calls-to-action and contact paths (phone, form, calendar)
- [ ] Google Business Profile verified, accurate, and updated with photos/posts
- [ ] Directory listings are consistent for name, address, and phone

## Content and Proof
- [ ] Recent projects documented with photos, scope, and budget ranges
- [ ] At least five strong reviews with owner replies
- [ ] Pricing/expectations explained somewhere prospects can read
- [ ] Simple nurture plan (email or social) that runs weekly or biweekly

## Paid Media

- [ ] Budgets tied to allowable CPA and lead goals
- [ ] At least two creative variants per active campaign

## Sales Enablement

- [ ] Calendar link configured with buffer times and reminders
- [ ] Proposal or scope template ready to send fast
- [ ] Objection responses written for the top 5 concerns

## Systems and Analytics

- [ ] Follow-up tasks auto-created for new leads and no-shows
- [ ] Weekly or biweekly dashboard reviewed by the team
- [ ] Recurring tasks scheduled for content, reviews, and maintenance

## How to use this
- Any **0** in Foundations, Trust, or Digital Presence is the first fix.
- Pick 2–3 low scores, set owners, and schedule work in the related section of the playbook.
- Re-run this checklist every quarter; keep notes in your client workspace so trends are visible.
