# Quick Wins

Use these when you need momentum in days, not weeks. Tackle one from each group.

## Trust and Proof
- [ ] Ask three recent clients for reviews; reply to every review on Google
- [ ] Add two recent projects to Google Business Profile with photos and a short write-up
- [ ] Publish one strong testimonial on the homepage and contact page
- [ ] Add a simple “Who we’re a fit for” section to the site to set expectations

## Digital Presence
- [ ] Check that phone, email, and service area match on the site and Google Business Profile
- [ ] Put a clear call-to-action above the fold (call, form, or calendar link)
- [ ] Run a quick performance scan and compress oversized images
- [ ] Add schema for business details if it’s missing (name, address, phone, hours)

## Content and Nurture
- [ ] Publish a pricing or budget ranges explainer (ranges are fine)
- [ ] Add a short FAQ that covers timing, budget, and process
- [ ] Send one helpful email to past clients/prospects with a recent project or tip
- [ ] Post one “in-progress” photo set to social and GBP with a short caption

## Paid and Follow-Up
- [ ] Turn on retargeting for site visitors with at least two creative variants
- [ ] Add UTMs to every active ad and confirm conversions are firing
- [ ] Set a same-day follow-up task for every new lead in the CRM
- [ ] Send a fast “thanks for reaching out” email template with next steps

## Systems and Process
- [ ] Create a simple pipeline in the CRM (New lead → Discovery → Proposal → Closed)
- [ ] Schedule weekly review time for leads, tasks, and dashboard checks
- [ ] Save shared links to key templates: discovery questions, proposal, and admin access
- [ ] Document one recurring task cadence (reviews, photos, or content) and assign an owner
