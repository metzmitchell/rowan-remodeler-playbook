# Sales-Marketing Alignment

**Owner:** MM (Facilitator), RJ (Sales Lead), SE (Marketing Execution)  
**Framework:** Revenue Team Model

---

## Core Alignment Mechanism

**Bi-weekly Revenue Team Meeting** is where alignment happens.

**Standing Agenda:**
1. **RJ shares:** Buyer questions, objections, what prospects are asking
2. **SE/MM report:** Content performance, what's working in Assignment Selling
3. **Team plans:** Editorial calendar based on sales intel
4. **RJ reports:** Pipeline review, where deals stall
5. **MM reports:** Marketing metrics (leads, CAC, attribution)
6. **Team aligns:** Action items for next 2 weeks

**See:** [Revenue Team Model](../01-foundations/01-the-revenue-team-model.md) for complete framework

## Shared Goals & Handoffs

### Shared Metrics
- Total qualified leads (both own this number)
- Lead-to-close conversion rate
- Average deal size
- Customer lifetime value
- Cost per acquisition

### Handoff Process

**Lead Flow:**
```
Marketing generates lead (MM/SE/JH)
  ↓
HubSpot capture + nurture (SE)
  ↓
Assignment Selling content (SE/CRM Vendor)
  ↓
Lead qualifies (passes to RJ)
  ↓
RJ continues Assignment Selling
  ↓
Close
```

**Content Flow:**
```
RJ shares buyer question
  ↓
MM prioritizes
  ↓
SE writes or JH films
  ↓
SE adds to Assignment Selling library
  ↓
RJ uses with prospects
  ↓
RJ reports what works
  ↓
Repeat
```

## Marketing Makes Sales Look Great

**Marketing provides:**
- Educational content RJ assigns prospects (bio videos, process guides, Big 5 articles)
- Sales kit materials (JH designs)
- CRM automation for follow-ups
- Lead qualification before handoff
- Data on which content helps close

**Sales provides:**
- Real buyer questions and objections → informs content priorities
- Feedback on which content works → do more of it
- SME participation in content (appear on camera, provide input)
- Testimonial coordination with clients

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Meet bi-weekly** — non-negotiable rhythm
2. **Sales shares intel** — what prospects actually ask
3. **Marketing responds** — creates content addressing those questions
4. **Sales uses content** — Assignment Selling adoption
5. **Track what works** — close rate by content engagement

**Common failure:** Skipping meetings, creating content in vacuum, sales doesn't use it
