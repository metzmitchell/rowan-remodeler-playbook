## What Is Assignment Selling?

> "Assignment Selling is the strategic practice of requiring prospects to consume specific educational content before sales conversations to improve close rates and reduce sales cycles."  
> — Marcus Sheridan

**The data:**
- Prospects who engage with 30+ pages before first appointment close at **80%**
- Prospects without that engagement close at **25%**
- Close rate improves with each additional piece consumed

**Why it works:** Educated buyers are committed buyers. Self-qualification eliminates tire-kickers.

## The 3 Ws of Assignment Selling

1. **WHAT** to assign — Which content (SE creates/organizes)
2. **WHEN** to assign it — Which sales stage (RJ defines)
3. **WHY** it matters — How you communicate importance (RJ executes)

---

## Content Library Structure (SE Manages)

**Organized in HubSpot by:**
- **Sales stage** (pre-discovery, pre-estimate, pre-contract, objection-handling)
- **Topic** (pricing, process, reviews, comparisons, problems)
- **Format** (video, blog, PDF guide, case study)

**Core Assignment Selling Content:**

### Pre-Discovery Call
1. Founder/team bio video (2-3 min) — Who we are
2. What to expect video (5-10 min) — Full process
3. Pricing guide (blog) — Realistic budgets
4. Reviews page — Social proof

### Pre-Estimate Presentation
1. Case study similar to their project (video or blog)
2. Process deep-dive (blog) — Pre-construction, communication
3. Value explanation (blog) — "Why We Cost What We Cost"

### Pre-Contract Signing
1. Client testimonial (video) — Similar project
2. Problem handling (blog) — Warranty, resolution
3. Timeline/disruption guide — What to expect during

### Objection-Specific
- **"Too expensive"** → Value content, ROI, cost breakdown
- **"Takes too long"** → Timeline explainer, why rushing costs more
- **"Worried about disruption"** → Living through remodel guide
- **"Not sure about design"** → Design consultation video, portfolio

## Assignment Selling Script (RJ Uses)

**First inquiry response email:**

> "Thanks for reaching out about your [kitchen/bathroom] remodel!
>
> Before we schedule a consultation, I'd like you to review a few resources (takes ~20 minutes). Homeowners who review these before our first meeting make faster decisions, feel more confident, and have better experiences.
>
> Please watch/read:
> 1. [Bio video link]
> 2. [What to expect video link]
> 3. [Pricing guide link]
> 4. [Reviews page link]
>
> Once you've reviewed these, email me back and we'll schedule. Looking forward to talking!
>
> [Name]"

**Key:** Explain WHY (better experience, faster decisions), make it easy (direct links), require completion before scheduling.

## Tracking Assignment Completion

**In HubSpot:**
- Track which content each prospect opens/watches
- Lead scoring based on engagement
- Automated reminders if not completed
- MQL → SQL trigger when threshold met (e.g., 3 of 4 pieces consumed)

**RJ reviews:** Who's completing assignments (prioritize these leads), who's not (follow up or deprioritize)

---

## Measuring Success

**Monthly metrics:**
- Assignment completion rate (% of prospects who complete)
- Close rate: completers vs. non-completers
- Time from inquiry to close (completers should be faster)
- Average deal size (completers often higher)

**Goal:** 70%+ completion rate, 2x close rate for completers

**In Revenue Team meetings:** Which assignments work best? What content needs updating?

---

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Not requiring it** — "Hey, check this out if you want" doesn't work. Require it.
2. **Assigning too much** — 20 min of content max, not 2 hours
3. **Poor organization** — SE must make library searchable for RJ
4. **Not tracking** — If HubSpot doesn't track engagement, you can't measure effectiveness
5. **Sales doesn't actually use it** — RJ adoption is critical
