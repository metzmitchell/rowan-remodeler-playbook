# Winback Campaign Strategy

Reach out to past clients and invite them back to your space or see how they're doing.

## Implementation

In your CRM, set a reminder after clients quit to follow up in 6 months, or batch send these every six months (ideally personalized messages).

## Best Practices

- Don't reach out if they have moved cities or it's inappropriate to do so
- Personalize messages when possible rather than using generic templates
- Focus on genuine relationship building rather than immediate sales
