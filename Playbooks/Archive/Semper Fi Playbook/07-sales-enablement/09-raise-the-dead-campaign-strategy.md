# Raise the Dead Campaign Strategy

Reach out to past leads and invite them back to your space or see if they're interested in discussing new options and availabilities.

## Implementation

Set a reminder after you mark leads as dead to follow up in 6 months, or batch send these every six months (ideally personalized messages).

## Best Practices

- Personalize messages when possible rather than using generic templates
- Highlight new options, availability, or changes since last contact
- Focus on providing value and re-establishing connection rather than immediate sales
