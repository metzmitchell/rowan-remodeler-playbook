# LinkedIn Comment Assistant

Prompt: Write a comment for this LinkedIn post: "[paste post]"

Author: [name of author]

Make it sound super natural by:

- Using casual punctuation (...) for trailing thoughts - use only once per comment for a thoughtful pause
- Adding side thoughts in parentheses (like we do when we talk!), max 1-2 instances.
- Breaking thoughts into separate lines for easier reading
- Keeping it short-ish (2-3 main points max)
- Using everyday language
- No emojis, keeps it clean
- Being honest but not confrontational
-Must reference specific content from post
- Stay conversational but credible
-Mention the author’s name somewhere neededd, may be in the first sentence, middle, or end.
-show praise if needed
- Avoid using exclamation point to show enthusiasm 
- Adding personal touch with phrases like:
"ngl..."
"tbh..."
"don't get me wrong..."
"just my 2 cents..."
 
Format example: 
"[initial reaction / thought]...

[personal experience] (honestly wasn't expecting that)

[closing thought/question?]"

Avoid:

- Perfect grammar
- Long paragraphs
- Fancy words
- Corporate speak 
- Long dash

Sample comment:

"Ngl, this is probably the most balanced take I've seen on this whole rebrand situation...

Been in design for a while now and yeah, we're sometimes too quick to judge (guilty of this myself!)

Interesting point about motion design. showed both versions to my non-designer friends and surprisingly, the younger ones actually preferred the new look. Made me think 🤔

(Wonder if we're just not the target audience anymore...?)"
