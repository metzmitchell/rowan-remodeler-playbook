# Marketing Dashboard Template

We can organize this from the top down, starting with what leadership reviews, what the marketing team reviews, and specific detailed reports when we need a closer look. 

1. Company Leadership   
   1. KPI Dashboard 1-2 numbers  
   2. Quarterly Goals (high-level)  
2. Marketing KPI Dashboard Sheet   
3. Goals, projects, tasks in Google Doc  
4. Domo, Supplier & Platform Reports

## 1: Company Leadership

The [Leadership KPI Dashboard]([Your Spreadsheet URL]) already has the most important marketing metric \- the number of new leads.

If we want an additional metric, we could add cost per lead or return on marketing spend. Return on marketing is better to look at over 1-12 months, not weekly. 

The top level of goals can be tracked in the [Leadership_Goals_Sheet]([Your Spreadsheet URL]).

## 2: Marketing KPI Dashboard Sheet

This sheet, [Marketing KPI Dashboard Top-Level]([Your Spreadsheet URL]), is used in monthly marketing meetings to allocate resources. We want to see 3 things: Revenue added, marketing spend, and campaigns. Everything in that sheet is based on how those three things relate to each other.

This high-level focus will help us spot trends. For example, maybe we experimented with mailers in October, and saw an influx in November, even though most leads said “Google”. Or maybe we had a high cost per lead in Q1, but it was better than last year’s cost per lead.

Over time, we can add platform-specific metrics (below) into this KPI dashboard spreadsheet.

## 3: Goals, Projects, Tasks in Google Doc

The Google Doc, [Marketing Dashboard - [Company Name]]([Your Doc URL]) will be a hub for tracking the Quarterly Goals along with sub-tasks.

As a replacement for our Notion dashboard, this will be easier to navigate. Especially since we use Google Docs for everything else. Like the Notion dashboard, it will be a directory for all marketing reports and projects.

## 4: Domo, Supplier & Platform Reports

We will use these reports when we need to dive deeper into a specific idea. When we determine a specific tactic. All reports will be linked in the Google Doc Dashboard.

Monthly and quarterly marketing reports from the PR team can be used to lead discussions, and can be referenced by leadership to check on progress or activities.

When we need to look into specific channels or ideas, we will keep reports linked within the Google Doc dashboard. This includes things like CallRail, Buildertrend reports, and any supplier reports.

The following metrics can be tracked within specific platforms, and we can eventually add them into the marketing KPI dashboard spreadsheet.

* Domo  
  * This can be where we determine the quality of the leads.  
  * Existing metrics   
  * Leads by source

  * Engaged Sessions
