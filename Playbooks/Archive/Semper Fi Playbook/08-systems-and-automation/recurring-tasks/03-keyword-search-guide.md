# Keyword Search Guide

Google search for offices/remodeling in your market. This is how your prospects are searching. Pretend you're them.

## Process

1. **Search Main Keywords** - Google search your primary service keywords as a prospect would

2. **Analyze Results** - Review what pages are showing up:
   - What pages are ranking?
   - What types of content ranks?
   - What directories or platforms appear?

3. **Identify Opportunities**:
   - Can you reach out to local media to get featured on top lists that currently rank?
   - Does Craigslist or Yelp show up—and if so, can you ensure you're visible on those platforms?
   - Are you running ads in all the right places?
   - Are there other directories you're not listed on that rank on the first or second page?

4. **Take Action** - Prioritize opportunities and add them to your marketing plan
