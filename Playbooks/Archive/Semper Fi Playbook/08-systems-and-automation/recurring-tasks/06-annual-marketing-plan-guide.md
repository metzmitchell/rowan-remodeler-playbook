# Annual Marketing Plan Guide

Create a roadmap for everything you wish to accomplish this year. Start with the big quarterly priorities and schedule them out.

## Process

1. **Start with Quarterly Priorities** - Identify major initiatives for each quarter

2. **Schedule Major Projects** - Map out when key projects will be executed

3. **Refine the List** - Ensure it's aligned with what you can really accomplish:
   - Be realistic about capacity
   - Consider dependencies between projects
   - Account for seasonal factors

4. **Add Recurring Tasks** - Add appropriate new repeating tasks to your recurring tasks system

5. **Review Quarterly** - Check progress and adjust as needed throughout the year

## Key Elements to Include
