# NAP Consistency Process

NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistency is critical for local SEO. Search engines and AI platforms cross-verify business information across multiple sources. Inconsistencies can confuse algorithms, reduce trust signals, and negatively impact local search rankings.

## Establishing Your NAP Standard

Before creating any new listings, establish your exact NAP format:

1. **Business Name**: Choose one official name and use it consistently everywhere
   - If your legal name differs from your marketing name, decide which to use publicly
   - Avoid variations like "LLC" vs "Inc" unless legally required
   - Example: "Semper Fi Custom Remodeling" (not "Semper Fi Remodeling" or "Semper Fi Custom Remodeling, LLC")

2. **Address Format**: Standardize your address format
   - Include or exclude suite/unit numbers consistently
   - Use the same abbreviation style (St. vs Street, Ave vs Avenue)
   - Match exactly what appears on your Google Business Profile
   - Example: "29 Montford Avenue, Ste 200, Asheville, NC 28801"

3. **Phone Number**: Use one primary phone number
   - Include area code consistently
   - Use the same format (with or without dashes, parentheses)
   - Avoid using tracking numbers as your primary published number
   - Example: "(828) 357-8350" or "828-357-8350" (pick one format)

4. **Website URL**: Always use your primary website
   - Never use Facebook page or other social profiles as your website URL
   - Use the same domain format (www vs non-www should match your website)
   - Example: "https://www.yourbusiness.com"

## Auditing Existing Listings

Before creating new listings, audit existing ones:

1. **Search for Existing Listings**
   - Google your business name + location
   - Search on major directories (Yelp, Yellow Pages, Manta, etc.)
   - Check industry-specific directories (Houzz, Angi, HomeAdvisor)
   - Use tools like BrightLocal or Whitespark to find citations

2. **Document All Variations**
   - Create a spreadsheet listing all found listings
   - Note any NAP inconsistencies
   - Document the platform, current NAP, and what needs to be corrected

3. **Prioritize Corrections**
   - Start with high-authority sites (Google, Bing, Yelp, BBB)
   - Then correct industry-specific directories
   - Finally, correct smaller citation sites

## Performing Consistency Checks

Regular consistency checks ensure NAP remains accurate:

1. **Quarterly Audit**
   - Search for your business name + location
   - Check top 20-30 directory listings
   - Verify NAP matches your standard exactly

2. **After Any Business Changes**
   - If you move, change phone numbers, or rebrand
   - Update Google Business Profile first
   - Then systematically update all directory listings
   - Use the [Listing Management Template](./02-listing-management-template.md) to track updates

3. **Use Consistency Tools**
   - BrightLocal Citation Tracker
   - Whitespark Local Citation Finder
   - Moz Local (if subscribed)
   - Manual Google searches for verification

## Common NAP Inconsistencies to Avoid

- **Name variations**: "ABC Remodeling" vs "ABC Remodeling LLC" vs "ABC Remodeling, Inc."
- **Address abbreviations**: "St." vs "Street", "Ave" vs "Avenue", "Ste" vs "Suite"
- **Phone formats**: "(828) 357-8350" vs "828-357-8350" vs "828.357.8350"
- **Missing suite numbers**: Including suite in some listings but not others
- **City variations**: Using different city names if you're near city boundaries
- **Website variations**: Using www vs non-www inconsistently

## Best Practices

- **Document your NAP standard** in your internal documentation
- **Update Google Business Profile first** - it's the most authoritative source
- **Use data aggregators** (Neustar Localeze, Factual) to distribute consistent data to hundreds of sites
- **Monitor regularly** - set calendar reminders for quarterly consistency checks
- **Correct immediately** when inconsistencies are found
