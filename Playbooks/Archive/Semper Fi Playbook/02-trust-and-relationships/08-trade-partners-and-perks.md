# Trade Partners and Perks Guide

Create relationships with local businesses to refer clients both ways, perhaps at a slight discount.

i.e. in the case of a remodeling business

1. Hotels - discounted meeting space and day rates for guests (and get a discounted room rate for clients as a perk)
2. Print Shops - offer a discount on some services (and get discounted specialized printing services for clients)
3. Coffee shops & restaurants - post a poster on their board, and vice versa (have a discount if possible for local shop/restaurant as a client perk, post it to board in the space)
4. Gyms - create a special for gym clients and offer your clients a discount/special offer at the gym as a perk
