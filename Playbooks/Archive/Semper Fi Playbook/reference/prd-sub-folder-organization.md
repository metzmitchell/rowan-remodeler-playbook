For all folder pages, I want to update.

I want it to be basically a task list. 

1:
Many of the md docs under folders are empty. 

For example 
10 > GSC Setup.md is a blank document. 
If there are any blank documents, they need to be turned into no link automatically. So the program should sense that there's no content in the document before allowing it to be a clickable link within the sidebar or markmap. If I were to add text within the document in this codebase, then it would automatically be clickable

2:
I want the folder pages to be more clearly a process. I want it to include the number in all of the titles.
