# Performance Creative

**Owner:** Performance Media Vendor, JH (Assets), SE (Insights)  
**Framework:** Gary Vaynerchuk's Day Trading Attention

---

## The Gary Vee Creative Philosophy

> "Creative is the critical variable. Targeting and data matter, but if your ideas, stories, and visuals don't resonate, you lose."  
> — Gary Vaynerchuk

**The shift:** Instead of one "big idea" campaign, test 20-50+ creative variations to find what actually resonates.

---

## High-Volume Creative Testing

### The Approach

**Traditional:** Create 2-3 ad variations, run for weeks, hope one works  
**Gary Vee:** Create 20-50+ variations, test simultaneously, kill losers fast, scale winners

**Why volume matters:**
- Different creative resonates with different people
- Algorithms favor fresh creative (performance decays)
- One winning creative can 10x campaign performance
- You don't know what works until you test

### Creative Variation Framework

**One project completion video → 20+ ad variations:**

**Vary by:**
- **Hook** (first 3 seconds): Before/after reveal vs. cost breakdown vs. client quote vs. problem statement
- **Format**: Vertical video vs. carousel vs. static image vs. UGC-style
- **Angle**: Design focus vs. value focus vs. trust focus vs. process focus
- **Length**: 15 sec vs. 30 sec vs. 60 sec
- **CTA**: "See more projects" vs. "Get free estimate" vs. "Calculate your cost"

**Performance Media Vendor tests all variations, kills bottom 50% after 48 hours, scales top 10%.**
