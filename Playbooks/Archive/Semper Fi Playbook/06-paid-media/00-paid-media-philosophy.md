# Paid Media Philosophy

**Owner:** MM (Strategy), Performance Media Vendor (Execution)  
**Framework:** Gary Vaynerchuk's Day Trading Attention

## Core Philosophy: Organic First, Amplify Winners

> "Let data from organic platform performance pick the winners. Amplify only those assets that resonate."  
> — Gary Vaynerchuk

**Traditional approach (wasteful):**
- Create campaign creative
- Run paid ads hoping it works
- Waste budget on underperforming content

**Gary Vee approach (efficient):**
1. Create high volume of organic content (free)
2. Post across platforms, track engagement
3. Identify top 10% performers (likes, shares, comments, completion rate)
4. Amplify ONLY proven winners with paid spend

**Result:** Lower CPA, higher ROI, more authentic creative
