# Search your main keywords on Google to see if you can show up in more places on the first page

Status: Bi-Annually

Google search for offices/coworking in your market. This is how your prospects are searching. Pretend you’re them.

- What pages are showing up?
- Can you reach out to local media to get featured on top lists that currently rank?
- Does Craigslist or Yelp show up - and if so, can you ensure you’re visible on those platforms?
- Are you running ads in all the right places?
- Are their other directories you’re not listed on that rank in on the first or second page?
