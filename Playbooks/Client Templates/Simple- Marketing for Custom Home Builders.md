## Overview

This document provides specialized marketing insights for custom home builders who already have marketing fundamentals in place (website, branding, local SEO, referrals) and focuses on the unique, industry-specific ways to go from good to great in the luxury custom home market. high-value emotional purchases, long sales cycles, and limited qualified prospects.

The unique strategies for marketing as a custom builder that you won’t find in general marketing knowledge.

## It's a Branding Problem

- Custom home building allows you to work with fewer clients, build awe-inspiring homes, and reduce operational bloat.
- This is often a branding problem, unlike production homes, which are more about specs and pricing
- People choose custom builders they connect with and trust
- Define and communicate your values
- Represent your company with the same care and beauty as your homes - on your website, your design studio, your social media, your construction sites, your vehicles, everywhere they might see

## It's a Time Game

- People think about their dream home for a long time before they pick a builder.
- Each client is a long relationship
- The stakes are high for the builder and the buyer
    - Biggest purchase of the client's life
    - Single projects represent significant portions of your income
- The custom home building industry has very long time horizons compared to other B2C industries.
- Your company will grow slower at the beginning and faster later on
    - Barrier to entry is long-term investment in your reputation, which reduces the amount of custom builders with 5-10 years of reputation.
    - Production construction is faster to scale, but more competitive at scale.

## Trade Relationships

Be public about your partners. Bring them up. Long time horizons means that reciprocity will be more likely to work.

- Especially with realtors, architects, and designers
- Mention your partners in your marketing
- Give architects and designers credit wherever you're featured - social media, portfolio, news
- Create newsletter for them specifically (IE: architect monthly newsletter)

- Invest in the people skills of every client facing role
- Have a strong mission and internal brand that your entire company is aligned with
- Create an event around their move-in day (ribbon cutting ceremony)
- Ask for referrals and reviews when they're most excited - contract signing and move-in
- Create a program for ongoing maintenance and care for your clients

## Miscellaneous Marketing Angles

- AI Engine Optimization = basic strong SEO + PR & large digital footprint
- Low-volume, high ticket sales means you have fewer opportunities for reviews
- This makes a bad review much worse than other industries
- This means you should invest more to acquire good reviews
- Ask employees and trade partners for some of your reviews - just keep majority client reviews
- Send mail to people who purchase residential lots in your target communities
- Sales brochures, printed materials, handwritten notes
- Make SEO content about the luxury communities you want to build in
- Make a landing page about your custom home building services per region / commonly searched area

- Their primary residence location often correlates with direct flights to your location
- Try targeting those locations with your search ads
- Consider Fixed Base Operator partnerships, or advertising with your local airport if it's small
- Partner with expensive experiences - regional symphony, high-end tourism experiences, expensive summer camps

## Nurture a Small TAM

- Curate exclusive events
- Invite prospects, clients, past clients, realtors, architects, designers, media
- Actually call people to invite them

- Make content at the event, use it to promote the next one

## Build a Content Library

- Retain ownership of your video and photo assets
- Have footage and storage standards
- Re-use one editor as much as possible, so they know all your best shots

- Use when hiring bottlenecks limit sales throughput
- Employer narrative, trades spotlights, apprenticeship pipeline
