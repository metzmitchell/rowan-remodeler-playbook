# Writing for Linkedin
## **1. The Power of the Headline**

- **“On the average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy.”** – *David Ogilvy*
    - Meaning: Your first line (hook) determines whether someone keeps reading.
- **80/20 Principle**
    - Ogilvy suggests you’ve spent 80% of your effort once you craft a strong headline/hook.

## **2. Hooks: Your 90% Advantage**

- **Clarity Over Cleverness**
    1. Jasmin’s tip: Ask, “What’s the ONE takeaway you want your reader to get?” Put that in your first line.
- **Keep It Short**
    1. One-liner hooks draw more attention on LinkedIn. Avoid lengthy paragraphs that get cut off.
- **Two Strategies for a “Re-Hook”**
    1. **Address an Objection Immediately**
        - Example: “This is the easiest way to get clients—no budget required.”
    2. **Use Contradiction**
        - Example: “LinkedIn is the #1 business platform. But it’s the worst place to pitch your product.”

## **3. Writing for LinkedIn Posts**

- **Think of the Feed**
    - LinkedIn shows only three lines before the “see more” prompt. Make those lines count.
- **Profile Is a Landing Page**
    - If the post is your ad, your profile is where you convert. Keep your headline, banner, and call-to-action crystal clear.
- **Visual Formatting**
    - Use line breaks to create “breathing space.” Large blocks of text get skipped.
    - 4x5 image ratio if you add visuals—takes up more screen space, ensuring you’re the only post on-screen.

## **4. Tone & Simplicity**

- **Dear-Son Framework**
    - Start your draft with “Dear [someone you care about]” and end with “Love, [Your Name].” Write warmly and simply. Then delete those lines.
    - This keeps your language human and jargon-free.
- **Conversational Copy**
    - Use everyday words; test by reading it out loud. If you stumble or it sounds awkward, rewrite.
- **No Jargon, No Fluff**
    - Clarity and brevity win on LinkedIn—people scroll quickly.

## **5. Commenting Strategy & Visibility**

- **More Comments, More Exposure**
    - Posting daily means you’re seen once a day. Commenting strategically on others’ posts can get you seen 20–50 times per day.
- **Add Value in Comments**
    - Instead of saying “Great post,” share an extra tip or perspective. Write comments for everyone reading, not just for the author.

## **6. Ogilvy’s Principles in a Modern Context**

- **“When you advertise fire extinguishers, open with the fire.”** – *David Ogilvy*
    - Don’t bury the lead—start with the most compelling point in your hook.
- **Focus on Benefits**
    - Readers want to know “What’s in it for me?” immediately.

## **7. Final Checkpoints**

- **Is the Headline (Hook) Clear and Enticing?**
- **Does the First Line Deliver a Promise?**
- **Does the Re-Hook Strengthen or Contradict the Hook to Build Curiosity?**
- **Are You Using Concise, Conversational Language?**
- **Do You Have a Clear CTA or Next Step (especially on your LinkedIn profile)?**

Use these bullet points as quick reminders while filming or going live. Happy writing—and remember Ogilvy’s timeless advice: a compelling headline (or hook) can be the difference between being read or being ignored.
