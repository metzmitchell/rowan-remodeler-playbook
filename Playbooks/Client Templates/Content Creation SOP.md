# Content Creation SOP
15 minute max video (linkedin length limit)

- Youtube - good description - include link high in description
- Linkedin - write content custom, say link in comments
- Instagram - just upload the same thing as linkedin, but say link in bio, create reel thumbnail (4:5)
- Twitter - short tweet, with link to blog post
- Facebook - exactly same as linkedin
- Adding the link to the post is an option as well (whatever's easier)

- **Content Splintering**
    
    Receive Assets
    
    Create Blog Post
    
    - Use the graphic as the featured image. Include it in the post. Optimize the image before uploading
    - If there’s a Youtube video attached:
        - Put the youtube video near the top by copy pasting the link into the post
    - Copy google doc text into this tool: [https://saasytrends.com/gdoc-to-html](https://saasytrends.com/gdoc-to-html)
        - Then copy the text from there into the blog post (cleans up the HTML)
    - Use the thumbnail as the featured image (compress to WEBP first)
    
    Create Linkedin Post
    
    - Post between 6AM and 11pm EDT
    - Leave 5-10 comments on other people’s Linkedin content before posting
        - Make sure that the draft/notes from the “Post” document won’t be included in the Linkedin
        - Some contents on posts, but also respond to comments within the comments sections
        - Focus on AI, homebuilders, marketers
        - Make sure the comments are actually valuable and interact with the content and provide a unique perspective instead of just reiterating what was already said in the post or comments. Do not just go with the generic AI generated comment. Make it sound very realistic. Shorter than 2 paragraphs, longer than a few words.
        - These comments are very important and need to be high quality.
    
    Keep an eye out for responses to the post or other comments for a few minutes after the post goes live.
    
    More to come:
    
    Add to ongoing newsletter
    
    Post to Instagram
    
    Post to Youtube if video
