# Getting Reviews for Builders

Status: Archive
Tags: Content, Task

Content idea

Jack saying formal walkthrough

- A nice “hey we’re done”

Include it in key emails

Employees and trades for reviews

Sending out through Buildertrend - asking for feedback  - probably built-in

- Unhappy people to feel heard so they don’ tend up wanting to leave a negative review

Call and then send a follow-up email 

Leave us a review page

Always ends up on the people who are in contact

- Ask at the contract sign
    - Sales flow documentation / messaging
- Grab all shareable review request links for all platforms
- ~~Ask builder marketer circle what gifts they like to give~~
    - ~~planter~~
    - ~~Nice chefs knife~~
    - ~~Come up with great list~~
- Share gifts internally
    - And trades
- Read the reviews in meetings - Hormozi

**Side notes**

- Often only think of this when you get a bad review
