# Do a "Winback" campaign

Status: Sales Strategies

Reach out to past clients and invite them back to your space/see how they're doing.

In the CRM, set a reminder after clients quit to follow up in 6 months, or batch send these every six months (ideally personalized messages). Don't do this if they have moved cities or it's inappropriate to do so.
