# Traditional Print and Offline Checklist

Establish offline marketing presence to complement digital efforts. These tactics build local brand awareness, support in-person interactions, and reach audiences who prefer traditional media. Complete tasks in order, starting with essential daily-use materials, then expanding to location-based signage and broader advertising channels.

**Prerequisites:** Ensure brand identity, messaging, and visual assets are established before creating print materials. These tactics work best when integrated with your digital marketing foundation.

## Phase 1: Essential Daily Materials

- [ ] **Business Cards** - Ensure professional business cards are current, include key contact information, and reflect your brand identity. Cards should be readily available for all team members who interact with clients or prospects.

## Phase 2: Location-Based Signage

- [ ] **Showroom and Office Signage** - Install clear, professional signage in showrooms and offices. Ensure visibility from the street and within mixed-use buildings. Signage should reinforce brand presence and make your location easily identifiable.

- [ ] **Job Site Signage** - Place professional signage on active job sites to promote your business to neighbors and passersby. Ensure signage is weather-resistant, clearly displays contact information, and complies with local regulations.

## Phase 3: Marketing Materials

- [ ] **Create Brochures** - Design and produce physical marketing brochures for offline promotion. Use brochures at home shows, in showrooms, during consultations, and for direct mail campaigns. Ensure content aligns with your messaging and showcases your best work.

- [ ] **Flyers and Postcards** - Design and distribute flyers or postcards to targeted local neighborhoods. Use for direct mail campaigns, door hangers, or handouts at local events. Focus on specific service offerings or seasonal promotions.

## Phase 4: Local Advertising Channels

- [ ] **Local Posters and Sandwich Boards** - Utilize posters and sandwich boards in high-traffic local areas for increased visibility. Place strategically near job sites, in community centers, or at local gathering spots. See [Offline Marketing Channels Reference](./01-offline-marketing-channels.md) for additional channel options.

- [ ] **Evaluate Additional Offline Channels** - Review and consider additional offline advertising opportunities based on your target market and budget. See [Offline Marketing Channels Reference](./01-offline-marketing-channels.md) for comprehensive list including billboards, transit advertising, newspaper, and industry publications.
