- Identify which Big 5 content to assign
- Pre-qualify budget and timeline fit
- Build rapport through good listening

## Discovery Questions by Big 5 Topic

### Pricing & Budget Discovery

- "Have you set a budget range for this project?" (qualify)
- "What's driving your budget—timeline, specific features, or overall investment?" (understand priorities)
- "Have you reviewed typical costs for projects like this?" (check if Assignment Selling content was consumed)
- "What's your plan for financing—cash, home equity, loan?" (feasibility)

### Problems & Concerns Discovery

- "What are your biggest concerns about this remodel?" (surface fears)
- "Have you had previous contractor experiences—good or bad?" (understand baseline expectations)
- "What would make this project a failure in your mind?" (identify must-avoids)
- "What keeps you up at night about this decision?" (deeper fears)

### Comparison & Decision Criteria

- "Who else are you talking to?" (understand competitive set)
- "What criteria matter most when choosing a contractor?" (price, quality, timeline, communication)
- "How will you make your final decision?" (decision process)
- "What would make you choose one contractor over another?" (winning criteria)

### Reviews & Trust

- "How did you hear about us?" (referral, search, review)
- "What impressed you when you researched us?" (what's working)
- "Have you read reviews from our past clients?" (check Assignment Selling completion)
- "Is there anything that would prevent you from trusting a contractor?" (address upfront)

### What to Expect & Process

- "What's your ideal timeline for starting and completing?" (alignment check)
- "How much disruption can you handle?" (kitchen/bathroom unavailable)
- "Who's involved in this decision—just you, or spouse/family?" (identify stakeholders)
- "What does success look like when this project is done?" (outcome focus)

## Using Answers to Assign Content

**If they haven't reviewed Assignment Selling content:**
- "I notice you haven't seen our [process video / pricing guide] yet. Let me send that over—it'll answer a lot of these questions and help you prepare for our meeting."

**If they express specific concern:**
- Budget anxiety → Send pricing breakdown, value content
- Timeline worry → Send timeline guide, "why projects take longer" content
- Trust issues → Send testimonials, "how we handle problems" content
- Decision paralysis → Send comparison content, buyer guide

**Goal:** Use discovery to identify gaps, assign relevant Big 5 content, improve qualification.

## After Discovery: Next Assignment

Based on call, assign pre-estimate content:
- Case study similar to their project
- Process documentation
- Value/pricing explainer (if needed)

**RJ:** "Before our estimate meeting, I'd like you to watch this case study of a project similar to yours. It'll help you see what's possible."
