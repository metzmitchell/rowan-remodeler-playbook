# Paid Media Philosophy

**Owner:** Marketing Leadership (Strategy), Performance Media Vendor (Execution)  
**Framework:** Gary Vaynerchuk's Day Trading Attention

## Core Philosophy: Organic First, Amplify Winners

> "Let data from organic platform performance pick the winners. Amplify only those assets that resonate."  
> — Gary Vaynerchuk

**Traditional approach (wasteful):**
- Create campaign creative
- Run paid ads hoping it works
- Waste budget on underperforming content

**Gary Vee approach (efficient):**
1. Create high volume of organic content (free)
2. Post across platforms, track engagement
3. Identify top 10% performers (likes, shares, comments, completion rate)
4. Amplify ONLY proven winners with paid spend

**Result:** Lower CPA, higher ROI, more authentic creative

## Budget Allocation Guidelines

**Typical allocation for remodelers ($50k-100k+ annual revenue in marketing):**

**Split guidance:**
- Google Search: 50% (highest intent)
- Meta (Facebook/Instagram): 30% (awareness, retargeting)
- YouTube: 15% (video, awareness)
- Other: 5%

**Flex based on performance** — shift budget to winners monthly. Adjust allocation based on what's working in your market.

## Quality Over Quantity

**Don't:** Dump entire budget into broad awareness campaigns  
**Do:** Tight targeting, clear offers, test small, scale winners

**For remodelers:**
- Target homeowners 45-75 in your market area
- In-market signals (home improvement interest, homeowner)
- Geographic radius (20-30 miles)
- Lookalike audiences from existing clients
