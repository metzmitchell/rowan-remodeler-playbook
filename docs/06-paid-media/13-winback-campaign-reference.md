# Winback Campaign Reference

Use this reference when establishing a winback campaign to re-engage past clients.

## Strategy

Reach out to past clients and invite them back to your space/see how they're doing.

## Implementation

In the CRM, set a reminder after clients quit to follow up in 6 months, or batch send these every six months (ideally personalized messages). Don't do this if they have moved cities or it's inappropriate to do so.
