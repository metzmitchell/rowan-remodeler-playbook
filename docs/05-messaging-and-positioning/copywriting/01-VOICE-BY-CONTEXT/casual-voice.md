# Casual Writing Voice Template

## Core Philosophy: Simple Beauty, Complex Depth

**Foundation:** Simplicity reveals understanding. If you can't explain it to a fifth grader, you probably don't understand it.

**Metaphor:** Like chess or Go - simple rules creating beautiful complexity. The best ideas work this way.

## Writing Style Elements

### Conversational Flow
- **Sounds like speaking** - but well-organized thoughts
- **Simple language** - no unpopular or complex words
- **Easy scanning** - reader can quickly grasp ideas
- **Natural rhythm** - mix of sentence lengths, no weird structures

### Humor Style: Dry & Subtle
- **Never on-the-nose** - no knock-knock jokes or puns
- **Barely there sarcasm** - so subtle it might be missed
- **Existential undertones** - hint at deeper questions without stating them
- **Dry observations** - matter-of-fact delivery of amusing insights

Example: "The computer exists to compute. But then again, don't we all exist to... compute something?"
(Still too obvious - aim for even more subtle)

### Philosophical Undertones
- **Never explicit** - no direct mentions of philosophy or religion
- **Understated depth** - reader senses deeper understanding
- **Big picture focus** - relate details to larger purpose
- **Hint at existential questions** - without using the word "existential"

## Personal Context for Natural References (Customize This)

### Life Details
- **Location:** [Your City/Region]
- **Partner/Family:** [Family details for anecdotes]
- **Work:** [Work environment/style]
- **Family:** [Family background]
- **Activities:** [Hobbies/Interests]
- **Background:** [Personal history]

### Values & Perspectives
- **[Value 1]** - e.g., "Techno-optimist"
- **[Value 2]** - e.g., "Minimalist"
- **[Value 3]** - e.g., "Work-focused"
- **[Value 4]** - e.g., "Financially responsible"
- **[Value 5]** - e.g., "Inclusive & open-minded"

### Professional Context
- **[Role 1]** - e.g., "Marketing professional"
- **[Role 2]** - e.g., "Builder associations involvement"
- **[Background]** - e.g., "Creative background"

## Duration-Based Applications

- More personal references
- Extended metaphors

### Personal Writing

## What NOT to Do

### Avoid These Elements
- Religious references (unless relevant to brand)
- Direct philosophical statements
- Complex vocabulary
- Corporate speak
- Obvious jokes or puns
- Excessive sentence complexity
- AI-sounding language

### Keep Natural Flow
- Don't force humor - let it emerge naturally
- Don't explain philosophical points - just hint
- Don't overcomplicate - simplicity is the goal
- Don't lose the conversational feel

## Key Principle
Writing should feel like a well-organized version of how you naturally speak - accessible, subtly humorous, with undertones of deeper thinking, but never pretentious or overly complex.
