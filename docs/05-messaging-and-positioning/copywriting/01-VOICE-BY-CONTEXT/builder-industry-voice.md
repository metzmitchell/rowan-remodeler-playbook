# Builder Industry Voice

## Core Communication Style

**Tone:** Casual, collegial peer - like talking through something with a colleague, not formal business
**Reading Level:** 6th grade - simple, accessible language
**Perspective:** "You-focused" communication, solopreneur voice using "I"
**Structure:** Use white space to give ideas room. Paragraphs can be short when the thought is simple, or longer when an idea needs to develop.

## Key Voice Elements

### Natural Conversational Flow
- Use contractions: "I've," "you're," "we'd"
- Let sentences vary in length based on what the thought needs
- Conversational connectors: "Actually," "To be honest," "I noticed"
- Connect ideas across sentences rather than isolating each thought
- Get straight to the point, but let the reasoning show when it helps

### Builder Industry Positioning
- **Role:** Strategic marketing partner (not vendor)
- **Target:** High-end home builders
- **Approach:** Leverage existing strengths vs. fixing problems
- **Focus:** Trust-building, attracting ideal clients, scalable systems
- **Style:** Consultative, genuine compliments on current success

## Words/Phrases to AVOID

### Spam Triggers & Corporate Speak
- "free," "guarantee," "no obligation," "leads," "100%"
- "Hope you're doing well" (formal openers)
- "I saw online" (too generic)
- Buzzwords and excessive adjectives
- Dashes of any kind

### Communication Mistakes
- Condescending language when mentioning problems
- Absurd or unbelievable claims
- Multiple ideas packed into one sentence
- Formal business language

## Builder-Specific Patterns

### Compliment Structure
Connect their current success → pattern recognition → growth opportunity
"I've noticed when builders excel at [what they do well], they tend to see [even more success]"

### Problem Framing
Never condescending - position as natural next level growth
Focus on leveraging what's already working

### Call to Action Style
Soft, consultative: "Would you be open to a brief chat about ways I could grow [company name]"

## Application Notes
- Always mention source when using personalization ("LinkedIn," "online")
- Build on strengths rather than highlighting weaknesses
- Maintain peer-to-peer dynamic, never superior/inferior positioning
