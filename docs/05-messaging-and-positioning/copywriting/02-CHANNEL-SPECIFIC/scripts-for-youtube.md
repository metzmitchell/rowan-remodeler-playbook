# YouTube Script Preferences

## Natural Speaking Patterns
- **Write for speech, not reading** - Scripts should sound like casual conversation
- **Include natural filler words** - "So", "Look", "Yeah" when they feel natural
- **Add conversational transitions** - "Let me show you what I mean"

### Cohesion and Connective Language
- **Use function words and discourse markers for flow** - Favor connective tissue like coordinating/subordinating conjunctions (and, but, so, because, while), determiners (the, this, that), prepositions (for, with, about), and discourse markers (then, so, look) to bind ideas into smooth, continuous sentences.
- **Prefer connected sentences over fragments** - Lean into compound/complex sentences that read naturally on a teleprompter; avoid telegraphic, list-like stacks of short sentences.
- **Contractions are fine; avoid clipped words** - Keep "it's" and "you're," but do not use shortened words or slangy abbreviations (info, vid, pics, btw), and write "and" instead of ampersands.

## Avoid Kitchy Language
- **No overused phrases** - Avoid "Boom!", "Mind blown?", "Game-changer!", "Here's the deal"
- **No question-answer patterns** - Don't use "Solution? Solution." or "Problem? Answer." - just state the answer directly
- **Remove inflammatory language** - Avoid "drives me crazy" or overly emotional statements
- **Sound observational, not excited** - Dry humor over enthusiasm
- **Natural expressions** - "That's pretty cool" vs "That's absolutely incredible!"
- **Avoid forced inclusivity** - Don't overuse "our industry" when unnatural

## Script Formatting (Movie Script Style)
- **Use brackets for all non-spoken elements** - [SCREEN: Show website], [CUT TO: Face cam]
- **Keep stage directions concise** - 5-10 words max in brackets
- **Action callouts** - [TYPE ON SCREEN: "exact text"], [UNSCRIPTED: brief description]

## TELEPROMPTER FORMAT REQUIREMENTS
- **Minimize bracketed stage directions** - Keep technical notes to absolute minimum in main script
- **Write clean, flowing text** - Optimize for reading on teleprompter without visual clutter
- **Use natural paragraph breaks** - Create reading rhythm that works with teleprompter scrolling
- **Avoid excessive formatting** - Bold, italics, and special characters can clutter teleprompter display
- **Include source citations naturally** - Weave citations into spoken content flow rather than bracketed notes
- **Create companion production documents** - Separate detailed screenshare outlines and technical notes
- **Focus on spoken-word flow** - Prioritize readability over production guidance in main script
- **Natural pausing points** - Structure paragraphs to allow for natural breathing and emphasis

### Teleprompter Script Structure:
```
Main Script (Teleprompter-Optimized):
- Clean spoken content only
- Natural paragraph breaks
- Minimal technical interruptions
- Sources woven into dialogue

Companion Production Outline:
- Detailed screenshare instructions
- Technical setup notes
- B-roll requirements
- Editing notes
```

## Content Structure Preferences
- **Start with end result** - Show the final product before explaining how it works
- **Focus on practical value** - What can viewers actually do with this information
- **Include live demonstrations** - Show real work happening, not just talking about it
- **Remove formal section headers** - Let content flow naturally without "The Problem", "The Solution" labels
- **Use connectors for flow** - Add "and", "but", "or" to connect ideas instead of choppy sentences
- **Make content actionable** - Specific steps and examples over abstract concepts
- **End with gratitude** - "Thanks for watching" instead of challenge CTAs

## Voice Characteristics to Maintain
- **Conversational but organized** - Like talking to a friend who knows their stuff
- **Confident but not arrogant** - Share knowledge without talking down
- **Personal but professional** - Mention real details when relevant

## SOURCE CITATION REQUIREMENTS
- **Always include sources when presenting data, statistics, or research findings**
- **For market research or data-heavy scripts**: Use comprehensive guidelines from `/90-GENERIC-PROMPTS/Market-Research-Script-Template.md`
- **For other scripts**: Basic citation format:
  - Cite sources naturally: "according to [Source] report" or "based on [Study]"
  - Include sources section at end
  - Mention key sources during presentation for credibility
  - Use primary sources, not secondary research documents

Notes:
- Keep energy high but natural
- Emphasize accessibility and real results
- Always verify and cite sources for credibility
- Optimize scripts for teleprompter reading while maintaining all production guidance in companion documents

Important! Use a casual voice, natural talking flow - writing a script to be spoken.

## YouTube Description Template

### Required Structure:
1. **Hook/Opening** - First 2-3 lines that appear in preview
2. **Key Takeaways** - Bullet points of main insights
3. **Call-to-Action** - Specific next step for viewers
4. **Required Links Section** - Always include these links:

**🔨 Connect With Me:**
- Website: https://[Your Consultancy].build
- Blog: https://blog.[Your Consultancy].build
- Tools & Resources: https://tools.[Your Consultancy].build
- YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@[Your Consultancy]Build
- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/[Advisor]ell-metz

### Description Guidelines:
- **First 2-3 lines** are critical - they appear in preview and must hook viewers
- **Include relevant hashtags** for homebuilding/marketing/construction
- **Keep it scannable** with bullet points and clear sections
- **Add timestamps** for longer videos (optional but recommended)
- **Include a specific CTA** that relates to the video content
- **Always include the required links section** for cross-platform engagement

### Updated YouTube Description Rules:

#### Required Link:
**Always include this link (unless there is another specific link mentioned in the video):**
[Your Consultancy] | Construction Industry Marketing: https://[Your Consultancy].build

#### Tag Section:
**Add a section for relevant tags to copy-paste into the tags field on YouTube:**
```
**YouTube Tags (copy/paste):**
construction marketing, builder gifts, client experience, referrals, home building, remodeling, construction business, marketing strategy, custom homes, luxury homes, builder marketing, construction referrals, client appreciation, closing gifts, home builder tips, construction industry, builder success, client retention, word of mouth marketing, construction sales, builder relationships, home renovation, construction company, builder growth, client satisfaction, construction referrals, builder marketing tips, luxury construction, design-build remodeler, construction business tips, builder client gifts, construction marketing strategy
```

#### No Timestamps:
**Don't include timestamps in the description.**

#### YouTube Markdown Formatting:
YouTube allows some Markdown-style formatting in video descriptions, but with specific syntax:

- **Bold:** Wrap your text in single asterisks, like *this*, to make it bold. For example, typing *Important update* in your YouTube video description will display as **Important update**.

- **Italics:** Wrap your text in single underscores, like _this_, for italics.

- **Strikethrough:** Wrap your text in hyphens, like -this-, for strikethrough.

**Important formatting notes:**
- Use single asterisks for bold (not double asterisks like standard Markdown)
- Use single underscores for italics (not double underscores)
- Ensure there are spaces around the formatting symbols to render formatting correctly
- Bold text will work, while words directly next to punctuation may not format as expected
- Example: *bold text* will work, while *bold text* may not format properly
