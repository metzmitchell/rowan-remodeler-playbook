# Mitch's Email Communication Patterns

## Opening Styles by Context
- **Formal/Support requests:** "Hello," 
- **Team communications:** "Hello all,"
- **Personal/direct:** "Hey [Name],"

## Core Structure Formula
1. **Context Setting** - Always explain the "why" first
2. **Clear Purpose Statement** - What this email is about
3. **Organized Information** - Bullet points, bold headers, logical flow
4. **Specific Next Steps** - Clear actions and timelines
5. **Collaborative Close** - How recipient can respond/help

## Key Voice Elements

### Professional but Approachable
- Maintains professionalism without being stiff
- Uses "I'd love to..." instead of "I need you to..."
- Balances directness with politeness

### Highly Organized Information
- **Bold headers** for different sections
- Bullet points for easy scanning
- Links embedded naturally in context
- Clear separation between different types of information

### Context-Rich Communication
- Always explains background before requests
- References previous conversations ("Kyle mentioned...")
- Provides reasoning for timelines and decisions
- Links to relevant documents/resources

### Collaborative Language Patterns
- "I don't want to disrupt your existing process"
- "Just let me know where things stand and how I can help"
- "Any help would be greatly appreciated"
- "Please let me know what feedback you have"

### Specific and Actionable
- Concrete timelines ("next couple of weeks")
- Specific quantities ("100-200" door hangers)
- Clear decision points ("ready to move forward with one design")
- Detailed change logs with context

## Subject Line Style
- Direct and descriptive
- Action-oriented when appropriate
- Context-specific (not generic)

Examples:
- "Deleting Notion Account" (direct problem)
- "Remodel Landing Page Doc for Review" (action + context)
- "Door Hanger Designs" (simple, clear)
- "Photos of Scroggs Team for Landing Page" (specific purpose)

## Things That Make Emails Effective
1. **Front-loaded clarity** - Purpose is clear within first sentence
2. **Logical information hierarchy** - Most important items first
3. **Respectful of recipient's time** - Organized for quick scanning
4. **Collaborative tone** - Invites feedback rather than demands compliance
5. **Comprehensive context** - Enough background to act without follow-up questions

## Avoid These Patterns
- Long paragraphs without breaks
- Burying the ask at the bottom
- Unclear or missing next steps
- Generic subject lines
- Assuming context without explanation
- **Using "ensure"** - be direct instead
- **Over-explaining** - stick to essential information

## Personal Voice Integration

### The Simplicity Principle in Emails
- **Complex topics → Simple explanations** (fifth-grader test)
- **Technical jargon → Plain English** 
- **Abstract concepts → Concrete examples**
- **Like chess** - simple structure, powerful results

### Natural Personality Markers
- **Subtle dry humor** - never forced, might be missed
- **Conversational flow** - sounds like organized speaking
- **Big picture connections** - relate details to larger purpose
- **Understated confidence** - no need to prove intelligence

### Duration-Based Application

#### Quick Emails (1-3 sentences)
- Ultra-efficient simplicity
- Personality through word choice
- Skip humor unless it flows naturally
- Clear action focus
- **Minimal additions** - don't expand on original content unnecessarily

#### Standard Emails (1-2 paragraphs)
- Full conversational tone
- Light humor where appropriate  
- Context-rich explanations
- Natural personality throughout

#### Detailed Emails (multiple sections)
- All voice elements active
- Deeper conceptual connections
- Personal anecdotes if relevant
- Still scannable with headers/bullets

### Voice Consistency Checklist
Before sending any email:
- ✓ Would I say this in person?
- ✓ Is complex info explained simply?
- ✓ Does it sound like me, not AI?
- ✓ Is the humor subtle (if present)?
- ✓ Have I connected to bigger picture?

### Example Transformations

**Generic:** "I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out regarding..."

**With Voice:** "Hey [Name], I've been thinking about our project..."

**Corporate:** "Please find attached the requested documentation for your perusal."

**With Voice:** "I've attached the docs you asked for - let me know if you need anything else."

**Technical:** "We need to implement a Redis caching layer to optimize database query performance."

**With Voice:** "Our database is getting slow. Think of Redis like a notepad where we jot down frequent answers so we don't have to look them up every time. Simple fix, big speed boost."
