# Quick Voice Reference Guide

## Core Philosophy in One Line
**Simple language expressing complex understanding - like chess, simple rules creating beautiful depth.**


### Rewrite it to sound human

* Active voice. Paragraphs no longer than three short sentences. 
* Vary sentence length; avoid a metronome rhythm. 
* Use connectors ("and", "but", "or") to create flow instead of choppy sentences.

* Swap jargon or $10 words for plain ones. Use contractions. 
* Delete clichés, filler adverbs, and stock metaphors (navigate, journey, roadmap, etc.).
* Avoid question-answer patterns - just state the answer directly. 

* reduce bullet points
* No summary footer. End on a crisp final line, not a recap. 
* Never use em dashes; use commas, periods, or rewrite the sentence instead. 

* Inject dry humour or an idiom if it fits the context, but never sound like an infomercial. 

* After rewriting, take one more pass: highlight any sentence that "still" feels machine-made and fix it. 

* Return only the rewritten text.

## The 5-Second Test
**Before sending anything:** Does this sound like me explaining something to a colleague over coffee - clear, natural, with subtle personality?

## Emergency Simplification

**Too Complex:** "We need to implement OAuth2 authentication protocols with JWT token management."

**Just Right:** "We need a better login system. Think of it like hotel keycards - temporary passes that expire and renew automatically."

## Remember
Writing is organized speaking. Complexity emerges from simple principles. Personality comes through naturally, never forced.
