# Global Writing Standard

**⚠️ MANDATORY REFERENCE: Consult this for all final written output to keep voice consistent.**

---

## Core Philosophy
**Simple language expressing complex understanding.**

## Voice Principles

### Universal Guidelines

#### Core Values
- **Calm clarity first:** Default to clear, confident statements. If choosing between attention-grabbing and accurate/grounded, choose accurate/grounded.
- **Clarity > cleverness:** Hierarchy of goals: 1) Be clear. 2) Be accurate. 3) Be kind. 4) Only then, be clever. If something clever makes it less clear, cut it.
- **Intelligent audience:** Write for a smart operator who has already tried things. Avoid “you’ve been doing it all wrong” framing. Assume good intentions and partial progress.

#### Always Follow These Rules
- ✓ **Simple words** (ninth-grader test)
- ✓ **Conversational flow**
- ✓ **Big picture connections**
- ✓ **Natural personality**
- ✓ **Structured empathy:** When describing problems, use concrete “you might be here if…” lists based on real people.
- ✓ **Collaborative exploration:** Invite the reader into the thinking. Let ideas build and connect rather than landing as declarations.

#### Never Do This
- ✗ **Complex vocabulary**
- ✗ **AI-generic language**
- ✗ **Forced humor**
- ✗ **“TED talk on X”** — Never say “TED talk on [topic]”
- ✗ **Theatrics with money:** Treat price and risk like logistics, not drama. State numbers and terms plainly.
- ✗ **Staccato punchiness:** Avoid choppy, declarative one-liners stacked in sequence. Let sentences breathe and connect.

### Writing Checklist for Human-Sounding Content

1. **Active voice.**
2. **Vary sentence length;** avoid a metronome rhythm. Mix longer, flowing sentences with shorter ones when they serve the thought.
3. **Swap jargon or $10 words for plain ones.** Use contractions.
4. **Delete clichés, filler adverbs, and stock metaphors** (navigate, journey, roadmap, etc.).
5. **Reduce bullet points** when prose would feel more natural.
6. **No summary footer.** End on a crisp final line, not a recap.
7. **Never use em dashes;** use commas, periods, or rewrite the sentence instead.
8. **Don’t write “question then answer” statements.** Instead, just make it into a sentence.
9. **Inject dry humor or an idiom** if it fits the context, but never sound like an infomercial.
10. **Let paragraphs breathe.** Not every paragraph needs to be 1–2 sentences. When an idea needs room to develop, give it room.
11. **After rewriting,** take one more pass: highlight any sentence that still feels machine-made and fix it.
12. **Return only the rewritten text** (when instructed).

## Context-Specific Communication

### Professional Writing
- **Subtle dry humor** when appropriate
- **Short, relevant big-picture notes** — keep philosophical points tight and relevant
- **Collaborative tone** with clients and partners
- **Clear next steps when appropriate** — not every piece needs to be prescriptive
- **Direct by default, nuanced when needed** — default to clear statements. Use one honest hedge (often, tends to, in most cases) when topics are genuinely context-dependent.

### Personal/Casual Writing
- **Full personality** expression
- **Philosophical undertones** welcome
- **Personal references** when relevant

### Quick Communications
- **Minimal personality** markers
- **Clear actions** and next steps
- **Pure efficiency** focus

## Personality Markers

### Subtle Humor Style
- **Dry observations** that might be missed
- **Never obvious** or attention-seeking
- **Natural placement** within content

### Personal Context References
- **[Your Location]**
- **[Partner/Family references]** (for personal anecdotes)
- **[Your Perspective/Beliefs]**
- **[Your Preferences]**

## The 5-Second Test
**Before sending anything:** Does this sound like me explaining something to a colleague over coffee — clear, natural, with subtle personality?

## Writing Process Guidelines

1. **Write naturally first** — don’t overthink the initial draft.
2. **Simplify vocabulary** — replace complex words.
3. **Check rhythm** — vary sentence lengths.
4. **Add personality** — subtle touches where appropriate.
5. **Final review** — does it sound human?
