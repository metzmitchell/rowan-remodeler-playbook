# Social Media Strategy

**Owner:** SE (Posting), JH (Creative Production)  
**Framework:** Gary Vaynerchuk's *Day Trading Attention*

---

## Core Philosophy

> "Attention is the game. More specifically, underpriced attention is the opportunity."  
> — Gary Vaynerchuk

**Principles:**
- **Volume matters** — 11 posts/day across platforms (2026 target)
- **Platform-native** — Don't cross-post, adapt for each culture
- **Organic first, amplify winners** — Free reach identifies top content, then boost with ads
- **Execution beats perfection** — Post consistently, learn, iterate

---

## 2026 Posting Targets

**Total: 11 posts/day**

| Platform | Posts/Day | Purpose |

| Facebook | 2 | Longer storytelling, community, local visibility |
| Instagram | 2 | Visual portfolio, Reels, Stories |
| YouTube Shorts | 2 | Educational shorts, before/after reveals |
| LinkedIn | 2 | Business lessons, thought leadership |

**Made possible by:** Gary Vee repurposing system (1 video → 10+ pieces)

## High-Volume Production Workflow

**Monday:** Plan (SE identifies topics, prepares captions)  
**Tuesday:** Capture (JH films 2-3 locations, 5-10 min each)  
**Wednesday-Thursday:** Batch create (JH edits into 15-20 pieces, SE writes captions)  
**Friday:** Schedule (SE loads week's content)

**Result:** 1 filming session → 15-20 pieces of scheduled content
