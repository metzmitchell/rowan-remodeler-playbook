# Reputation and Reviews Checklist

Establish a systematic approach to reputation management that proactively collects reviews, gathers feedback, and amplifies positive recognition. Complete tasks in order to build a sustainable review collection system.

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup

- [ ] **Set Up Review Management Tool** - Configure GatherUp or similar NPS/review management platform. Connect to Google My Business for automated review routing. See [GatherUp Guide](./01-gatherup-guide) for setup details.

- [ ] **Design Review Solicitation Strategy** - Establish review solicitation workflow at key client touchpoints. See [Review Solicitation Strategy](./02-review-solicitation-strategy) for best practices and touchpoint recommendations.

## Phase 2: Review Collection Implementation

- [ ] **Implement Contract Sign Review Request** - Add review request to contract signing process. Capture all shareable review request links for all platforms at this touchpoint.

- [ ] **Set Up Project Completion Review Request** - Create formal walkthrough process that includes review request. Send follow-up email with review links after completion call.

- [ ] **Create Review Request Page** - Build dedicated "Leave us a review" page on website with QR codes and direct links to all review platforms.

- [ ] **Set Up Employee and Trade Partner Reviews** - Establish process for collecting reviews from employees and trade partners on relevant platforms.

## Phase 3: Feedback and Issue Prevention

- [ ] **Implement Client Feedback Survey** - Set up post-project client feedback survey to identify unique value and improvement areas. See [Client Feedback Survey Template](./03-client-feedback-survey-template) for questions.

- [ ] **Configure NPS Survey Routing** - Set up Net Promoter Score survey using GatherUp. Configure routing so 10/10 reviews go to Google My Business, while 9/10 or lower receive feedback request. See [NPS Survey Guide](./04-nps-survey-guide) for setup.

- [ ] **Establish Negative Review Prevention Process** - Use Buildertrend or similar tools to proactively reach out to potentially unhappy clients before they leave negative reviews. Call and follow up with email to ensure they feel heard.

## Phase 4: Content Amplification

- [ ] **Establish Awards Posting Process** - Create standard workflow for posting awards on WordPress blog, updating portfolio page, updating awards page, and maintaining awards spreadsheet. See [Posting Awards SOP](./05-posting-awards-sop) for complete workflow.

- [ ] **Organize Portfolio by Project Type** - Structure project portfolio to showcase quality, process, and fit for ideal buyers. Organize by service type (kitchen, bathroom, whole-home) and include before/after photos, budget ranges, and client testimonials.

- [ ] **Create Client Case Studies** - Develop detailed case studies showing before/after transformations, decision criteria, challenges overcome, and results. Focus on stories that resonate with target buyer personas. See [Answering Hard Questions](../16-answering-hard-questions) for Big 5 reviews approach.

- [ ] **Set Up Internal Review Sharing** - Establish process to read positive reviews in team meetings to reinforce what clients value (Hormozi approach).

## Ongoing Maintenance

- [ ] **Run Periodic Review Campaigns** - Schedule regular campaigns to ask clients for reviews on Google My Business and other relevant directories. For physical businesses, post signage with QR codes linking directly to review pages.

- [ ] **Monitor Review Platforms** - Regularly check all review platforms for new reviews and respond appropriately.

- [ ] **Review Feedback Trends** - Analyze client feedback surveys and NPS scores to identify patterns and improvement opportunities.
