# Review Solicitation Strategy

Strategic approach to collecting reviews at key client touchpoints to build a steady stream of positive reviews.

## Key Touchpoints for Review Requests

### Contract Sign
- Ask for reviews at contract signing
- Capture all shareable review request links for all platforms at this point
- Include review request messaging in sales flow documentation

### Project Completion / Formal Walkthrough
- Create formal walkthrough process that includes review request
- Make it a nice "hey we're done" moment
- Call and then send follow-up email with review links
- Include review request in key project completion emails

### Dedicated Review Page
- Create "Leave us a review" page on website
- Include QR codes and direct links to all review platforms
- Make it easy for clients to find and use

## Additional Review Sources

### Employees and Trade Partners
- Set up process for collecting reviews from employees and trade partners
- Target relevant platforms where these relationships matter

### Buildertrend Integration
- Use Buildertrend's built-in feedback system to ask for reviews
- Proactively reach out to potentially unhappy clients before they leave negative reviews
- Call and follow up with email to ensure they feel heard

## Best Practices

### Proactive Approach
- Don't wait until you get a bad review to think about review collection
- Build review requests into your standard processes
- Always ends up on the people who are in contact with clients

### Internal Reinforcement
- Read positive reviews in team meetings (Hormozi approach)
- Share reviews internally to reinforce what clients value
- Use reviews to celebrate team wins

## Common Pitfalls

- Often only think of review collection when you get a bad review
- Not having review request links ready at key touchpoints
- Missing opportunities at natural moments (completion, walkthrough, etc.)
