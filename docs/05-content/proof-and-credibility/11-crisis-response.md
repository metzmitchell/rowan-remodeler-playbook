# Crisis Response

**Owner:** Owner + Marketing Lead  
**Purpose:** Preserve trust and reputation when mistakes or crises occur

---

## Core Principles for Builders

### 1. Respond Quickly, Thoughtfully

**Private issues:** Reach out within 24 hours. Call first, follow up with email.  
**Public issues:** Acknowledge within hours, provide full response within 24-48 hours.

**Why it matters:** Speed shows you care. Silence looks like avoidance.

---

### 2. Own the Mistake Completely

**Don't:** Blame subcontractors, suppliers, weather, or the client.  
**Do:** Take full accountability. "This is on us. Here's what happened and how we're fixing it."

**Trust builder:** Clients forgive honest mistakes. They don't forgive excuses.

---

### 3. Explain What Happened (Without Over-Explaining)

**Share:** What went wrong, why it happened (briefly), what you're doing to fix it.  
**Skip:** Lengthy technical justifications or defensive explanations.

**Example:** "We missed a detail in the permit process. We've corrected it and added a checklist to prevent this going forward."

---

### 4. Focus on the Solution

**Lead with:** What you're doing to make it right.  
**Include:** Timeline, who's handling it, what client can expect.

**Outcome focus:** Clients care more about resolution than root cause analysis.

---

### 5. Make It Right (Then Some)

**Go beyond:** Fix the issue + add something extra to restore confidence.  
**Examples:** Expedited timeline, upgraded material, extended warranty, discount on future work.

**Relationship repair:** Generosity after mistakes creates stronger loyalty than perfection.

---

### 6. Learn and Improve Publicly

**After resolution:** Share what you learned and what changed in your process.  
**Shows:** Commitment to continuous improvement, not just damage control.

**Example:** "This taught us to add a pre-pour inspection. We've updated our process for all future projects."

---

### 7. Keep Communication Human

**Avoid:** Corporate PR speak, legal jargon, robotic apologies.  
**Use:** Direct, honest, conversational language. Sound like yourself.

**Bad:** "We regret any inconvenience this may have caused."  
**Good:** "We messed up. Here's how we're fixing it."

## When to Go Public vs. Private

**Private response (call + email):**
- Individual client issues
- Project-specific problems
- Mistakes affecting one relationship

**Public response (social media, blog, email list):**
- Negative reviews getting traction
- Industry-wide issues affecting multiple clients
- Public accusations or misinformation
- Situations where transparency helps more than silence

1. Acknowledge the problem
