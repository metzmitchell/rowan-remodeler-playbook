# Content Marketing Checklist

Establish a comprehensive content marketing system that creates valuable content, distributes it effectively across platforms, and maintains consistent quality and engagement. Complete tasks in order to build a sustainable content marketing operation.

## Phase 1: Strategy & Foundation

- [ ] **Create Blog Content Strategy** - Develop comprehensive blog strategy including goals, categories, frequency, promotion plan, and implementation details (who creates content and budget required). Consider bringing in subject matter experts and involving clients to inform content for better resharing. See [Blog Content Strategy Guide](./04-blog-content-strategy) for framework.

- [ ] **Create Social Media Strategy** - Develop cross-platform social media strategy including goals, platform selection, posting frequency, target audience, tone of voice per platform, content mix, and examples to follow. See [Social Media Strategy Guide](./06-social-media-strategy) for framework.

- [ ] **Set Up Content Creation Standards** - Establish content creation SOP covering asset specifications, content splintering workflows, video production standards, and technical videography guidelines. See [Content Creation SOP](./03-content-creation-sop) for complete standards and workflows.

- [ ] **Set Up Video Footage Management System** - Establish video footage organization, storage, and utilization process. Create asset management file structure, set video standards, and establish editor relationship for consistent quality. See [Video Footage Utilization SOP](./12-video-footage-utilization-sop) for complete process.

- [ ] **Select Email Marketing Software** - Choose appropriate email marketing platform based on business type and needs. See [Email Marketing Software Reference](./08-email-marketing-software) for options.

## Phase 2: Content Creation Systems

- [ ] **Establish Content Readability Standards** - Ensure all content meets 5th-grade reading level for maximum accessibility and SEO. See [Readability Check Reference](./17-readability-check) for guidelines.

- [ ] **Set Up LinkedIn Writing Standards** - Establish LinkedIn content creation guidelines focusing on headlines, hooks, visual formatting, and conversational tone. See [Writing for LinkedIn Guide](./10-writing-for-linkedin) for principles and best practices.

- [ ] **Establish LinkedIn Commenting Strategy** - Set up process for strategic commenting on LinkedIn to increase visibility (20-50x more exposure than posting alone). Use [LinkedIn Comment Writing Assistant](./11-linkedin-comment-writing-assistant) prompt template for crafting natural, high-quality comments.

- [ ] **Set Up Community Marketing** - Participate in local Facebook communities and groups to build awareness naturally (with permission, adding value, never spamming).

## Phase 4: Ongoing Maintenance
