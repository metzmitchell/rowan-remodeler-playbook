# Content Philosophy

**Owner:** MM (Strategy), SE (Execution), JH (Production)  
**Frameworks:** Marcus Sheridan Big 5, Gary Vee Day Trading Attention

---

## Core Principle

> "The businesses that win are the ones that answer the questions buyers are already asking — especially the questions competitors avoid."  
> — Marcus Sheridan, *Endless Customers*

**For remodelers:** Content IS marketing. Homeowners research for 3-18 months, read 10+ blog posts, watch 5+ videos before contacting anyone. They choose contractors who helped them learn.

## The 7 Core Principles

### 1. Trust Before Transaction
Answer buyer questions thoroughly BEFORE asking them to contact you. Build authority through education.

### 2. Transparency Beats Perfection
What competitors hide (pricing, problems, weaknesses), you address head-on. Builds trust faster than testimonials.

### 3. Answer the Big 5 Questions
Pricing • Problems • Comparisons • Reviews • What to Expect

**These topics are uncomfortable. That's why they work.**

See [Answering Hard Questions](16-answering-hard-questions) for detailed strategy.

### 4. Organic First, Amplify Winners (Gary Vee)
- Create high volume of organic content (test for free)
- Track engagement
- Amplify only proven winners with paid spend

Result: Lower CAC, higher ROI, more authentic content.

### 5. Volume + Consistency = Compound Growth
**2026 Target:** 11 posts/day across platforms (TikTok 3, Facebook 2, Instagram 2, YouTube Shorts 2, LinkedIn 2)

**The 7-11 Rule:** Must be in front of clients for 7 hours or 11 interactions.

### 6. Platform-Native Content
Don't cross-post. Adapt for each platform's culture, format, algorithm.

**See:** [Social Media Strategy](06-social-media-strategy)

### 7. Content Supports Entire Buyer Journey
Map content to all 5 stages: Awareness • Research • Consideration • Decision • Advocacy

**See:** [Buyer Journey Mapping](buyer-resources/00-buyer-journey-mapping)

## Content as Revenue Team Asset

**Marketing creates, Sales uses:**
- Pre-qualify prospects (Assignment Selling)
- Answer objections
- Build authority
- Shorten sales cycles

**SE's job:** Organize content so RJ can quickly find and assign the right piece  
**RJ's job:** Share which content helps close deals → informs what SE creates more

---

## Quality Standards

**Voice:** Authentic, knowledgeable, approachable (not corporate)  
**See:** [Voice and Tone](02-voice-and-tone)

**AI-Assisted Creation:**
- Use AI to draft (60-70% quality)
- Always add: real project examples, local context, company voice, expert insights

**See:** [AI in Marketing](../01-foundations/03-ai-in-marketing.md#ai-content-workflows)

**Authenticity test before publishing:**
1. Does this help the buyer?
2. Is it accurate?
3. Does it sound like us?
4. Would we send this to a friend?
5. Does it build trust?

## Measuring Effectiveness

**Key metric (Sheridan):** Prospects who consume 30+ pages of content close at 80% vs. 25%

**Track:** Content-influenced leads, Assignment Selling completion rate, close rate by engagement level

**In Revenue Team meetings:**
- RJ: "What content helped close deals?"
- SE: "Top-performing content by engagement"
- MM: "What topics/formats are working?"
- Team: "What should we create more of?"
