# Answering Hard Questions: The Big 5

**Owner:** Content Manager, Marketing Lead (Strategy), Video Producer  
**Framework:** Marcus Sheridan's *They Ask, You Answer*

---

## What Are the Big 5?

> "The businesses that win are the ones that answer the questions buyers are already asking — especially the questions competitors avoid."  
> — Marcus Sheridan

**The Big 5 topics:**
1. **Pricing & Cost** — How much will this cost?
2. **Problems** — What could go wrong? What mistakes should I avoid?
3. **Comparisons** — How do my options compare?
4. **Reviews & Best** — Who's the best? What do others say?
5. **What to Expect** — What's the process? What will it be like?

**Why they matter:**
- Questions prospects Google at 11pm when they can't sleep
- Competitors avoid them (too uncomfortable)
- Answering builds instant trust
- Pre-qualifies leads, shortens sales cycles

**Sheridan's data:** Companies addressing all Big 5 see 300%+ increase in qualified leads. Prospects consuming Big 5 content close at 80% vs. 25%.
