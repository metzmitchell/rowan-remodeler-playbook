# Raise the Dead Campaign Reference

Use this reference when establishing a campaign to re-engage past leads.

## Strategy

Reach out to past leads and invite them back to your space/see if they're interested in discussing new options and availabilities.

## Implementation

Set a reminder after you mark leads as dead to follow up in 6 months, or batch send these every six months (ideally personalized messages).
