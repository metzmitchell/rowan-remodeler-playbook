# Systems and Organization Checklist

This checklist guides you through establishing the foundational systems, tools, and operational processes needed for effective marketing operations. Follow these steps in order to build a complete marketing infrastructure.

**Systems Philosophy:** Systematize repeatable processes to free up time for high-value relationship building. Automate lead nurturing, follow-ups, and content distribution while keeping trust-critical touchpoints (discovery calls, proposals, client check-ins) human. The goal is efficiency without losing the personal connection that wins builder business.

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup

### Initial Infrastructure

- [ ] **Set Up Tools and Software** - Install and configure essential marketing platforms:
  - [ ] Google Analytics
  - [ ] Google Tag Manager
  - [ ] Google Search Console
  - [ ] CallRail (if applicable)
  - [ ] Drift chat
  
  **Google Account Setup:** Rather than having various marketing-related software registered under the owner's email, consolidate it into one core email address. Ideally use `marketing@yourdomain.com` if you use GSuite, otherwise go to [accounts.google.com](http://accounts.google.com/) and sign up for a Gmail or attach an existing account as a Google account.

- [ ] **Create Shared Working Documents** - Set up collaboration infrastructure with client:
  
  **CLIENT:** Create a Google Drive folder and share access with your marketing lead
  
  **Agency / Marketing Lead:**
  - [ ] KPI Document
  - [ ] Strategy Document
  - [ ] Project Management Dashboard (see [Project Management Dashboard Template](./08-project-management-dashboard))
  - [ ] Login Credentials

- [ ] **Customize KPI Dashboard** - Tailor the standard KPI template to include specific metrics most important to the business owner. Customize to suit your needs.

- [ ] **Develop Initial Marketing Budget** - Create an initial marketing budget based on business goals and channel priorities.

## Phase 2: Operational Systems

### CRM and Lead Management

- [ ] **Set Up CRM Usage** - Configure CRM to track leads, client goals, and improve client experience. Store details including:
  - Where they heard about you first
  - What their goals are
  - Why they chose you
  - What you can do to make the experience exceptional

- [ ] **Establish Lead Qualification Process** - Set up lead scoring system in CRM to prioritize best-fit, ready-to-buy opportunities. Score leads based on project fit (budget, timeline, scope), engagement level (content consumed, responses), and qualification criteria. Focus sales time on highest-potential leads.

- [ ] **Define Handoff and Follow-up Process** - Create clear handoff process from marketing to sales, including lead qualification criteria, notification triggers, and follow-up timelines. Ensure no leads fall through cracks between marketing nurture and sales outreach.

### Communication and Documentation

- [ ] **Explain Key Documents to Client** - Walk client through the purpose and usage of essential project documents:
  - [ ] Login Credentials
  - [ ] KPI Document
  - [ ] Strategy Document
  - [ ] Project Management Dashboard (includes Call Notes)
  - [ ] Channel Summary

- [ ] **Establish KPI Document Usage** - Set up consistent usage and update process for the primary KPI tracking document. Update regularly with current metrics.

- [ ] **Establish Call Notes Process** - Document all meetings, decisions, and project updates in the Project Management Dashboard. Use the dashboard as the central hub for all project communication and decisions.

### Ongoing Operations

- [ ] **Plan Recurring Tasks** - Establish daily, weekly, and monthly marketing activities. Define ongoing tasks like:
  - Website updates
  - Blog posts
  - Social posts
  - Email campaigns
  - Ad campaigns or experiments

- [ ] **Choose Email Marketing Software** - Select appropriate email marketing platform based on business type and needs. Options include:
  - ConvertKit
  - ActiveCampaign
  - Hubspot
  - Mailchimp
  - Klaviyo (ecommerce)
  - Drip (ecommerce)

### Marketing Automation

- [ ] **Set Up Trigger-Based Workflows** - Configure event-driven automations for form fills, page visits, and quote requests to keep buyers moving without manual lag. Examples: welcome sequence after form fill, follow-up after pricing page visit, reminder after abandoned quote.

- [ ] **Create Email Sequences** - Build welcome, nurture, and re-engagement email sequences that stay in touch without sounding automated. Use conversational tone and provide value in each message.

- [ ] **Establish Lead Nurturing Program** - Set up long-term nurture campaigns for leads not ready to buy. Provide helpful, non-pushy follow-up content that keeps you top-of-mind during their 3-18 month research period.

## Phase 3: Advanced Systems

### Documentation and Organization

- [ ] **Document Systems and Processes** - Actively document all repeatable marketing systems and operational processes for future reference and team onboarding.

- [ ] **Set Up Project Management Dashboard** - Create central hub for managing marketing projects, tracking tasks, and recording meeting notes. See [Project Management Dashboard Template](./08-project-management-dashboard) for structure.

## Phase 4: Specialized Tools

### AI and Prompt Engineering

- [ ] **Create Context Documents** - Build usable context pack for the business using the specialized workflow. See [Prompt: Creating Context Documents](./09-prompt-creating-context-documents) for complete workflow and prompt templates.

- [ ] **Review Prompt Writing Guidelines** - Understand principles and specialized guidelines for writing effective AI prompts for research, copywriting, and analysis. See [Prompt Writing Guidelines](./10-prompt-writing-guidelines) for comprehensive guide.

## Phase 5: Offboarding (When Needed)

### End of Engagement

- [ ] **Execute Offboarding Process** - When engagement ends, follow the internal Offboarding SOP (maintained outside the client playbook) for clean asset handoff and access removal.
