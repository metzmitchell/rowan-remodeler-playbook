# Planning Recurring Tasks Guide

Use this guide to establish your daily, weekly, and monthly marketing activities. This helps you build a sustainable system for maintaining consistent marketing operations.

## Key Principles

- **Start with frequency**: Organize tasks by how often they need to be done (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.)
- **Be realistic**: Only commit to frequencies you can actually maintain
- **Build gradually**: Start with essential tasks and add more as systems mature
- **Use tools**: Set up reminders, calendars, or project management systems to track recurring tasks

## Setting Up Your System

1. Review the [Recurring Tasks Checklist](./00-recurring-tasks-checklist) to understand all available tasks
2. Identify which tasks are most critical for your business
3. Set realistic frequencies based on your capacity
4. Add tasks to your calendar or project management system
5. Review and adjust frequencies quarterly based on results and capacity

## Frequency Guidelines

- **Daily**: Essential operational tasks that keep systems running
- **Weekly**: Content creation and engagement activities
- **Monthly**: Analysis, optimization, and strategic maintenance
- **Quarterly**: Relationship building and strategic initiatives
- **Bi-Annual**: Deep analysis and campaign execution
- **Annual**: Strategic planning and major reviews
