# Winback Campaign Guide

Reach out to past clients and invite them back to your space/see how they're doing.

## Process

**In the CRM**, set a reminder after clients quit to follow up in 6 months, or batch send these every six months (ideally personalized messages).

## Important Considerations

- **Don't do this if they have moved cities** - Only reach out if it's geographically relevant
- **Don't do this if it's inappropriate** - Use judgment about relationship context
- **Personalize when possible** - Personalized messages perform better than batch sends

## Best Practices

- Reference specific past interactions or projects
- Offer something of value (update, new service, special offer)
- Keep tone friendly and non-pushy
- Track responses and engagement
