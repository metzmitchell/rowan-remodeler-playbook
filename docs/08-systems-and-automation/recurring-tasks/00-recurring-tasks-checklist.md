# Recurring Tasks Checklist

This checklist organizes all recurring marketing activities by frequency to help you maintain consistent marketing operations. Complete tasks according to their schedule to ensure your marketing systems stay active and effective.

**Note:** Before starting recurring tasks, ensure you've completed initial setup through the [Onboarding Checklist](../../templates/getting-started/00-onboarding-checklist) and [Systems and Automation Checklist](../00-systems-and-automation-checklist).

## Daily Tasks

- [ ] **Check Social Media & Respond to Comments** - Review all social platforms and respond to every comment. Goal: "No comment left behind." Like posts and engage authentically.

- [ ] **Review CRM & Follow Up with Leads** - Review CRM daily. Ensure every lead has a next action date. Touch base with prospects weekly or set a specific follow-up date. No lead should be without a next task/due date.

- [ ] **Publish Social Micro-Content** - Post at least one piece of micro-content daily (Instagram Stories, tweets, etc.). Don't worry about full posts every day if it's too much—focus on consistent micro-content.

- [ ] **Work on Weekly/Monthly Tasks** - Check and complete any outstanding weekly or monthly operational activities.

- [ ] **Continually Improve Systems** - Identify and implement ongoing improvements to marketing and operational systems.

- [ ] **Update Sign-Up Incentives** - Review and refresh sign-up incentives for new leads.
