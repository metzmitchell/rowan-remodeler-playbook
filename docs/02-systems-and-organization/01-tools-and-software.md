# Tools and Software

## Checklist


- [ ]  Google Analytics

## Set Up Google Account

Rather than having various marketing-related software registered under the owner's email, marketing managers, staff, etc., you want to consolidate it into one core email address, if possible.

Ideally it is something like [marketing@yourdomain.com](mailto:marketing@yourdomain.com) if you use GSuite, otherwise go to [accounts.google.com](http://accounts.google.com/) and sign up for a Gmail or attach an existing account (yourdomain.com) as a Google account.
