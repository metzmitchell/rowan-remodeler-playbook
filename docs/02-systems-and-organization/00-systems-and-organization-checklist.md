# Systems and Organization Checklist

This checklist guides you through establishing the foundational systems, tools, and operational processes needed for effective marketing operations. Follow these steps in order to build a complete marketing infrastructure.

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup

### Initial Infrastructure

- [ ] **Set Up Tools and Software** - Install and configure essential marketing platforms:
  - [ ] Google Analytics
  - [ ] Google Tag Manager
  - [ ] Google Search Console
  - [ ] CallRail (if applicable)
  - [ ] Drift chat
  
  **Google Account Setup:** Rather than having various marketing-related software registered under the owner's email, consolidate it into one core email address. Ideally use `marketing@yourdomain.com` if you use GSuite, otherwise go to [accounts.google.com](http://accounts.google.com/) and sign up for a Gmail or attach an existing account as a Google account.

- [ ] **Create Shared Working Documents** - Set up collaboration infrastructure with client:
  
  **CLIENT:** Create a Google Drive folder and share access with your marketing lead
  
  **Agency / Marketing Lead:**
  - [ ] KPI Document
  - [ ] Strategy Document
  - [ ] Project Management Dashboard (see [Project Management Dashboard Template](./01-project-management-dashboard.md))
  - [ ] Login Credentials
