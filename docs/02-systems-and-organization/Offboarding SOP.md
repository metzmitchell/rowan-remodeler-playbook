# Offboarding SOP

> **Work-in-progress note (Scroggs):** This SOP is being created **in real time while I go through the Scroggs offboarding**. Add/adjust steps as they happen, and capture exact links, owners, dates, and screenshots where helpful.

## Goal
End the engagement cleanly: deliver the final handoff, preserve the work, remove access appropriately, close billing, and leave a good last impression.

## When to use
- Engagement ends (planned or unplanned)
- Work pauses for 30+ days and access should be reduced
- Client switches internal owner or agency and needs a handoff

## Inputs you need (collect first)
- Contract end date + any required notice period
- Current scope + what’s actually in-flight
- List of platforms and where access is granted (accounts + permission level)
- Client primary contact + technical/admin contact
- Where assets live (Drive/Dropbox/Notion/Asana/etc.)


### 1) Confirm timeline + expectations
- [ ] Confirm last day of work + last meeting date
- [ ] Confirm what will and won’t be completed before end date
- [ ] Confirm what deliverables are included in the final handoff
- [ ] Confirm who receives the handoff + where it should live

### 2) Freeze / triage active work
- [ ] Inventory in-flight items (by channel/project)
- [ ] Mark each item as: **complete / handoff in-progress / cancel / client-owned**
- [ ] Capture current status, next step, and blockers for anything not complete

### 3) Final reporting + wrap summary
- [ ] Prepare final reporting period (dates)
- [ ] Write a plain-English “what we did / what we learned / what to do next” summary
- [ ] Include: wins, misses, key hypotheses, recommended priorities for next 30/60/90

### 4) Asset + knowledge handoff
- [ ] Deliver folder(s) with:
  - [ ] Creative/source files
  - [ ] Copy/docs/briefs
  - [ ] Campaign builds/exports (when possible)
  - [ ] Tracking docs (UTMs, goals, events)
  - [ ] Password handoff method (never in email)
- [ ] Deliver “how to run this” notes for recurring workflows
- [ ] Provide list of key links (dashboards, accounts, SOPs)

### 5) Access changes (add client ownership, then remove ours)
- [ ] Ensure client has admin/owner access everywhere needed
- [ ] Transfer ownership where applicable (domains, ad accounts, analytics, GTM, etc.)
- [ ] Remove/disable our access (and any contractor access) on the agreed date
- [ ] Confirm access removal is complete (spot-check)

### 6) Billing + admin closeout
- [ ] Confirm final invoice amount + what it covers
- [ ] Send final invoice and confirm payment date
- [ ] Cancel recurring subscriptions we pay for (or transfer to client)
- [ ] Export/store any time tracking required for records

### 7) Final client comms
- [ ] Send final handoff email/message with:
  - [ ] Links to assets + summary
  - [ ] What happens next + who owns what
  - [ ] Access change timing
  - [ ] How to reach us if something is missing (time-boxed)

### 8) Internal closeout
- [ ] Update CRM notes with engagement end + outcome
- [ ] Archive project files in the correct folders
- [ ] Capture “what I’d do differently next time” bullets
- [ ] Add reusable learnings to relevant SOPs/templates
