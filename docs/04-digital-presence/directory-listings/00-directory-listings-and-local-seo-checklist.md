# Directory Listings and Local SEO Checklist

This checklist guides you through establishing and maintaining directory listings and local SEO citations. Directory listings improve local search visibility and provide citation backlinks that strengthen your local SEO foundation. Follow these steps in order to build a comprehensive local presence.

**Strategic Context**: Directory listings and citations are foundational for local SEO. This work should be completed after your Google Business Profile and website are established, but before launching paid advertising campaigns. Consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) across all platforms is critical for search engine trust and local rankings.

## Phase 1: NAP Consistency Foundation

Establish your NAP standard and correct any existing inconsistencies before creating new listings. This foundation prevents confusion and ensures all future citations reinforce the same information.

- [ ] **Establish NAP Standard** - Document the exact Name, Address, and Phone (NAP) format that will be used consistently across all directories. This must match your Google Business Profile exactly. See [NAP Consistency Process](./01-nap-consistency-process) for detailed guidance.

- [ ] **Audit Existing Listings** - Search for existing business listings across major directories and note any inconsistencies in NAP information. Use the process in [NAP Consistency Process](./01-nap-consistency-process) to identify all existing citations.

- [ ] **Correct Existing Inconsistencies** - Update any existing listings with incorrect NAP information before creating new listings. Prioritize high-authority sites (Google, Bing, Yelp, BBB) first.

## Phase 2: Core Directory Listings

Submit to the most authoritative directories first. These platforms have the highest impact on local search visibility and serve as the foundation for your citation profile.

- [ ] **Submit to Core Directories** - Create listings on Google Business Profile, Bing Places, Apple Maps, Facebook Business, Yelp, and Better Business Bureau. See [Citation Building Guide](./03-citation-building-guide) for priority tiers.

- [ ] **Track Directory Credentials** - Document login credentials, URLs, and submission status for each directory in the [Listing Management Template](./02-listing-management-template).

- [ ] **Verify Listings Are Live** - Confirm each listing is published and accessible at the provided URL. Update the template with live URLs.

## Phase 3: Industry-Specific Directories

Industry directories often drive higher-quality leads and are trusted by search engines for industry-specific queries.

- [ ] **Submit to Industry Directories** - Create listings on relevant industry-specific directories (e.g., Houzz, Angi, HomeAdvisor, Porch, Thumbtack, BuildZoom for remodeling businesses). See [Citation Building Guide](./03-citation-building-guide) for industry directory recommendations.

- [ ] **Complete All Profile Fields** - Fill out complete profiles with descriptions, photos, services, and categories. Avoid duplicate content by writing unique descriptions for each platform.

- [ ] **Update Listing Management Template** - Add all industry directory listings to the [Listing Management Template](./02-listing-management-template) with credentials and URLs.

## Phase 4: Citation Building Expansion

Expand your citation profile with additional directories to strengthen local SEO signals. Consider using citation building services for efficiency on lower-priority directories.

- [ ] **Submit to Local Directories** - Create listings on local Chamber of Commerce, city-specific directories, and regional business directories. See [Citation Building Guide](./03-citation-building-guide) for strategy.

- [ ] **Consider Citation Building Service** - For Tier 4 general citation sites, consider using services like [Whitespark Citation Building Service](https://whitespark.ca/citation-building-submission-service/) to streamline the process while maintaining quality control on Tier 1-3 directories.

- [ ] **Track All Submissions** - Document all directory submissions in the [Listing Management Template](./02-listing-management-template) regardless of submission method.

## Phase 5: Ongoing Consistency Maintenance

Maintain consistency and monitor your citation profile regularly. Inconsistencies can develop over time as directories update information or new citations are created automatically.

- [ ] **Perform Quarterly NAP Consistency Check** - Audit all directory listings quarterly to ensure NAP information remains consistent. Use the process in [NAP Consistency Process](./01-nap-consistency-process).

- [ ] **Perform Messaging Consistency Check** - Verify that brand messaging, descriptions, images, and other content are consistent across all directory listings and external profiles.

- [ ] **Monitor for New Citations** - Search engines and directories may create listings automatically. Regularly search for your business and claim any unclaimed listings.

- [ ] **Update Information Regularly** - Keep hours, services, photos, and descriptions current across all platforms, especially after business changes.
