# Search Engine Optimization Checklist

Establish a comprehensive SEO system that improves organic search visibility, drives qualified traffic, and supports long-term marketing growth. Complete tasks in order to build a sustainable SEO foundation before moving to advanced optimization strategies.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Monitoring Setup

- [ ] **Set Up Google Search Console** - Claim and verify the business website in Google Search Console for performance monitoring, indexing status, and search query insights. Essential for tracking organic search performance.

- [ ] **Set Up Bing Webmaster Tools** - Configure Bing Webmaster Tools for search visibility on Microsoft's search engine. Submit sitemap and monitor Bing-specific performance metrics.

- [ ] **Verify URL Structure** - Ensure the website's URL hierarchy and structural organization are SEO-friendly. URLs should be clean, descriptive, and follow logical site architecture.

## Phase 2: Content Strategy & Research

- [ ] **Conduct Keyword Research** - Perform comprehensive keyword research to identify target terms, search volume, competition, and content opportunities. Document primary and secondary keywords for each service and location page.

- [ ] **Optimize Meta Titles and Descriptions** - Ensure all pages have unique, optimized meta titles (50-60 characters) and descriptions (150-160 characters) that include target keywords and compelling copy for search visibility.

## Phase 3: Content Quality & Structure

- [ ] **Content Readability Check** - Ensure all content matches a 5th-grade reading level for maximum accessibility and user engagement. Use tools like Hemingway Editor or Yoast readability analysis.
