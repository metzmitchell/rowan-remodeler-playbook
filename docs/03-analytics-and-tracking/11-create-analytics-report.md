# Create Analytics Report

Track things like:

- Traffic broken down by source (Organic, Direct, Referral, Email, Social, Ads, etc.)
- Traffic to key product/key service pages
- Conversions (broken down by source)
- Organic traffic breakdown (behavior, top landing pages, conversions)
- Ads traffic breakdown
- Blog content breakdown
- Referral sources
- On-site behavior by source of traffic (time on page, bounce rate, number of pages per session)
- Campaign performance (See: UTMs: [https://trello.com/c/HPxy4Adz](https://trello.com/c/HPxy4Adz)))
