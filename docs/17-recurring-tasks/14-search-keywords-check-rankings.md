# Bi-Annual Keyword Search

Google search for offices/remodeling in your market. This is how your prospects are searching. Pretend you’re them.

- What pages are showing up?
- Can you reach out to local media to get featured on top lists that currently rank?
- Does Craigslist or Yelp show up - and if so, can you ensure you’re visible on those platforms?
- Are you running ads in all the right places?
- Are their other directories you’re not listed on that rank in on the first or second page?
