# Raise the Dead Campaign Guide

Reach out to past leads and invite them back to your business/see if they're interested in discussing new options and availabilities.

## Process

Set a reminder after you mark leads as dead to follow up in 6 months, or batch send these every six months (ideally personalized messages).

## Best Practices

- **Personalize messages** - Reference specific past interactions or inquiries
- **Offer new value** - Highlight new services, availability, or options since last contact
- **Keep tone friendly** - Non-pushy, helpful approach
- **Track responses** - Monitor which leads re-engage and why

## CRM Setup

Configure your CRM to automatically set reminders 6 months after marking leads as "dead" or "inactive" to trigger this campaign.
