# Raise the Dead Campaign (Bi-Annual)

Reach out to past leads and invite them back to your business/see if they're interested in discussions new options and availabilities.

Set a reminder after you mark leads as dead to follow up in 6 months, or batch send these every six months (ideally personalized messages)
