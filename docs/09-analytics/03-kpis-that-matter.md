# KPIs That Matter

**Owner:** MM (Strategy), Owner (Business Goals)  
**Purpose:** Track metrics that tie marketing to revenue outcomes

---

## Core Principle

> "Vanity metrics feel good. Revenue metrics drive decisions."

**Focus on:** Metrics that directly connect to revenue, not just activity.

---

## Primary Revenue Metrics

### 1. Cost Per Lead (CPL)

**What it is:** Total marketing spend ÷ number of leads generated

**Why it matters:** Shows efficiency of lead generation across channels

**Builder context:**  
- Remodelers: $100-500 CPL typical (varies by market, project size)
- Custom homes: $500-2,000 CPL typical (longer sales cycle, higher value)

**Track by:** Channel (Google, Facebook, referrals, organic) to identify most efficient sources

---

### 2. Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)

**What it is:** Total marketing spend ÷ number of customers acquired

**Why it matters:** True cost to acquire a customer (accounts for conversion rate)

**Builder context:**  
- Remodelers: $1,000-5,000 CPA typical
- Custom homes: $5,000-15,000 CPA typical

**Rule of thumb:** CPA should be 10-20% of average project value

**Example:** $75k average project → $7,500-15,000 acceptable CPA

---

### 3. Close Rate

**What it is:** (Customers acquired ÷ leads generated) × 100

**Why it matters:** Shows sales effectiveness and lead quality

**Builder benchmarks:**  
- Cold leads: 5-15% close rate
- Referrals: 30-50% close rate
- Assignment Selling leads (30+ pages consumed): 60-80% close rate

**Improve by:** Better lead qualification, Assignment Selling, sales process refinement

---

### 4. Pipeline Value

**What it is:** Total value of all active opportunities in sales pipeline

**Why it matters:** Predicts future revenue, shows sales momentum

**Builder context:**  
- Track by stage: inquiry, consultation scheduled, estimate sent, contract negotiation
- Healthy pipeline: 3-5x monthly revenue target

**Example:** $500k monthly revenue goal → $1.5M-2.5M pipeline

---

### 5. Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

**What it is:** Average revenue per customer over their lifetime (including repeat projects and referrals)

**Why it matters:** Justifies higher acquisition costs for quality clients

**Builder context:**  
- First project: $75k average
- Repeat projects: 20-30% of clients return within 5 years
- Referrals: Each client refers 1-3 others on average
- **Total LTV:** $100k-200k per client

**Impact:** Higher LTV justifies higher CPA investment

---

## Secondary Performance Metrics

### 6. Lead-to-Consultation Rate

**What it is:** (Consultations scheduled ÷ leads generated) × 100

**Why it matters:** Shows lead quality and initial engagement effectiveness

**Target:** 30-50% for qualified leads

---

### 7. Consultation-to-Estimate Rate

**What it is:** (Estimates sent ÷ consultations held) × 100

**Why it matters:** Shows qualification and fit assessment effectiveness

**Target:** 60-80% (you should be sending estimates to most consultations)

---

### 8. Estimate-to-Close Rate

**What it is:** (Contracts signed ÷ estimates sent) × 100

**Why it matters:** Shows sales effectiveness and pricing competitiveness

**Target:** 30-50% for qualified estimates

---

### 9. Average Project Value

**What it is:** Total revenue ÷ number of projects

**Why it matters:** Tracks whether you're attracting target client profile

**Track over time:** Should increase as brand strengthens and targeting improves

---

### 10. Marketing Efficiency Ratio (MER)

**What it is:** Total revenue ÷ total marketing spend

**Why it matters:** Overall marketing ROI across all channels

**Builder target:** 5:1 to 10:1 (for every $1 spent, generate $5-10 in revenue)

**Example:** $100k marketing spend → $500k-1M revenue

---

## Content & Engagement Metrics (Leading Indicators)

### 11. Content Consumption

**Track:** Pages per session, time on site, video completion rate

**Why it matters:** Predicts close rate (Sheridan: 30+ pages = 80% close rate)

---

### 12. Assignment Selling Completion Rate

**Track:** % of leads who complete assigned content before consultation

**Why it matters:** Directly correlates to close rate and sales cycle length

**Target:** 70%+ completion rate

---

### 13. Email Engagement

**Why it matters:** Shows content relevance and audience engagement

**Builder benchmarks:**
