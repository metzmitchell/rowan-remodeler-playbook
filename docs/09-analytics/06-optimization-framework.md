# Optimization Checklist

Systematically optimize marketing systems by gathering client feedback, measuring performance, and continuously improving based on data and insights. Complete tasks in order to establish a sustainable optimization cycle.

## Phase 1: Gather Client Feedback

- [ ] **Survey Clients for Insights** - Survey clients to understand their selection criteria, satisfaction levels, and unique value perception. Use [Client Feedback Survey Template](../05-content/proof-and-credibility/03-client-feedback-survey-template) to structure questions.

- [ ] **Conduct Client Experience Meetings** - Personally meet with recent clients to gather qualitative feedback and understand their experience. Use these meetings to identify improvement opportunities and validate what's working.

- [ ] **Set Up NPS Survey System** - Implement Net Promoter Score survey using GatherUp or similar tool. Configure routing so 10/10 reviews go to Google My Business, while 9/10 or lower receive feedback request. See [NPS Survey Guide](../05-content/proof-and-credibility/04-nps-survey-guide) for setup details.

## Phase 2: Measure Performance

- [ ] **Check Conversion Rates** - Monitor and evaluate website conversion rates against industry benchmarks. General rule is around 5% for opt-ins/subscriptions/purchases, but refer to industry benchmarks where available. See [Conversion Rates Reference](./04-conversion-rates-reference) for guidance.

- [ ] **Review Full Funnel Coverage** - Ensure marketing addresses prospect needs across all stages: awareness, consideration, decision, and post-purchase. Verify content and campaigns exist for each stage.

## Phase 3: Optimize Systems

- [ ] **Document Systems and Processes** - Actively document all repeatable marketing systems and operational processes. Create clear documentation that enables consistency and scalability.

- [ ] **Optimize Based on Feedback** - Use client feedback and performance data to identify and implement improvements to marketing systems, messaging, and processes.

## Phase 4: Maintain Relationships

- [ ] **Send Client Gifts** - Offer occasional small gifts (like chocolate) around the holidays or after project completion, if appropriate. Maintains relationship warmth and shows appreciation.
