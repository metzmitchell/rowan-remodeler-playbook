# Marketing Writing Rules

**Use for:** All external-facing content including emails, marketing copy, social media, proposals, client communications, website content, and any writing that will be shared with others.

**Cross-reference:** Always consult [communication-style.md](./communication-style) (GLOBAL WRITING STANDARD) first, then apply these specific rules for marketing and external communication.

---

## Voice and Tone

- Write like humans speak. Avoid corporate jargon and marketing fluff.
- Default to confident, direct statements. Use softer phrasing (might, could, tends to) when dealing with complex, real-world nuance or when you want ideas to feel grounded rather than absolute.
- Use active voice instead of passive voice.
- Use positive phrasing—say what something *is* rather than what it *isn't*.
- Say "you" more than "we" when addressing external audiences.
- Use contractions like "I'll," "won't," and "can't" for a warmer tone.

## Specificity and Evidence

- Be specific with facts and data instead of vague superlatives.
- Back up claims with concrete examples or metrics.
- Highlight customers and community members over company achievements.
- Use realistic, product-based examples instead of `foo/bar/baz` in code.
- Make content concrete, visual, and falsifiable.

## Title Creation

- Make the value or topic clear in the title so readers know what they're getting. You don't need to promise dramatic results—just be specific and honest.
- If there's a genuine, meaningful tension or misconception in the topic, you can name it. Avoid hyped-up or oversimplified "controversial" framing just to grab attention.
- Share something uniquely helpful that makes readers better at meaningful aspects of their lives.
- Titles can be a clear opinion, a concrete claim, or a precise description of what you're exploring. Avoid vague, empty titles ("My thoughts on marketing"), but you don't have to shoehorn everything into a punchy opinion.
- Avoid titles that over-promise or imply a single, magical solution. No "one secret," "never fail," or "X will change everything" style framing.
- Write placeholder titles first, complete the content, then spend time iterating on titles at the end.

### Strict Bans - STOP IMMEDIATELY if you use any. Rewrite:

**Single words (Ruben Hassid's 2025 list):**
delve, realm, harness, unlock, tapestry, paradigm, cutting-edge, revolutionize, landscape, potential, findings, intricate, showcasing, crucial, pivotal, surpass, meticulously, vibrant, unparalleled, underscore, leverage, synergy, innovative, game-changer, testament, commendable, highlight, emphasize, boast, groundbreaking, align, foster, enhance, holistic, garner, accentuate, pioneering, trailblazing, unleash, versatile, transformative, redefine, seamless, optimize, scalable, robust, breakthrough, empower, streamline, intelligent, smart, next-gen, frictionless, elevate, adaptive, effortless, data-driven, insightful, proactive, mission-critical, visionary, disruptive, reimagine, agile, customizable, personalized, unprecedented, intuitive, leading-edge, synergize, democratize, automate, accelerate, state-of-the-art, dynamic, reliable, efficient, cloud-native, immersive, predictive, transparent, proprietary, integrated, plug-and-play, turnkey, future-proof, open-ended, AI-powered, next-generation, always-on, hyper-personalized, results-driven, machine-first, paradigm-shifting.

**Jodie Cook's phrases (2025):**
"It's not X, it's Y", "While X is important, Y is crucial", "In fact", "Indeed", "First and foremost", "Next", "Finally", "As a result", "Therefore", "In other words", "To put it simply", "Not only X but also Y", "On one hand, on the other hand".

## Avoid LLM Patterns

- Replace em dashes (—) with semicolons, commas, or sentence breaks.
- Avoid starting responses with "Great question!", "You're right!", or "Let me help you."
- Don't use phrases like "Let's dive into…"
- Skip cliché intros like "In today's fast-paced digital world" or "In the ever-evolving landscape of."
- Avoid phrases like "it's not just [x], it's [y]."
- Avoid self-referential disclaimers like "As an AI" or "I'm here to help you with."
- Don't use high-school essay closers: "In conclusion," "Overall," or "To summarize."
- Avoid numbered lists where bullets work better.
- Don't end with "Hope this helps!" or similar closers.
- Avoid overusing transition words like "Furthermore," "Additionally," or "Moreover."
- Replace "In conclusion" with direct statements.
- Avoid unnecessary hedging. Single, honest hedges (might, tends to, often) are fine when the idea is genuinely nuanced or context-dependent. Don't stack hedges or use them as a crutch.
- Don't stack hedging phrases: "may potentially," "it's important to note that."
- Avoid stock AI framings: "Here's how I see it," "Here's X, Y, Z," "Here's the thing," "TED talk on X" (never say "TED talk on [topic]")
- Don't create perfectly symmetrical paragraphs or lists that start with "Firstly… Secondly…"
- Avoid title-case headings; prefer sentence casing.
- Remove Unicode artifacts when copy-pasting: smart quotes ("), em-dashes, non-breaking spaces.
- Use `` instead of '' (straight backticks versus typographic apostrophes).
- Delete empty citation placeholders like "[1]" with no actual source.

## Punctuation and Formatting

- Use Oxford commas consistently.
- Use exclamation points sparingly.
- Sentences can start with "But" and "And"—but don't overuse.
- Use periods instead of commas when possible for clarity.

## Copywriting Template Framework

When writing marketing copy, use this structure:

**You are a sharp copywriter for [industry/business, e.g., custom home builders in Asheville]. Write [output type, e.g., 500-word landing page] about [topic, e.g., sustainable modular homes].**

### Core Rules:
- Use sentence case only. Capitalize just first words and proper nouns.
- Vary sentence length naturally. Let longer sentences carry complex ideas; use shorter ones for emphasis, not as a default mode.
- Default to direct, plain statements. Bring in gentle hedging when accuracy or complexity actually calls for it.
- Jump in mid-action. No intros like "In a world where" or summaries.
- Conversational tone like [voice example, e.g., blunt builder chatting at NAHB meetup].
- Collaborative, not declarative. Invite the reader into the thinking rather than handing down pronouncements.

### Output Guidelines:
- Output only the copy. No notes.
- Return only the rewritten text.
