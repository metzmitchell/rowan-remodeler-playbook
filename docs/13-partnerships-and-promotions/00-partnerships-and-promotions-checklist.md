# Partnerships and Promotions Checklist

Build strategic partnerships and referral programs that generate qualified leads while strengthening your local network. These initiatives work best after establishing foundational marketing systems (website, messaging, client relationships). Follow this checklist in order to build sustainable partnership channels.

## Phase 1: Client Referral Program

- [ ] **Design Client Referral Incentive** - Establish incentive structure for clients who refer new business. Consider cash rewards, discounts on future projects, or gift cards. Ensure incentive is meaningful but sustainable.

- [ ] **Create Referral Program Page** - Build dedicated referral program page on website explaining how the program works, who qualifies, and how to participate.

- [ ] **Promote Referral Program** - Link to referral program from website footer, include in email newsletters, mention in client communications, and display in office/showroom if applicable.

## Phase 2: Community Marketing

- [ ] **Identify Local Community Groups** - Research relevant local Facebook groups, Nextdoor communities, and neighborhood associations where your target audience participates.

- [ ] **Request Permission to Participate** - Contact group administrators to request permission to participate and understand community guidelines before posting.

- [ ] **Engage Authentically** - Participate in community discussions by adding value, answering questions, and sharing helpful information. Never spam or overtly promote. Build relationships naturally.

- [ ] **Monitor Community Engagement** - Regularly check community groups for opportunities to provide value and build awareness of your services.

## Phase 3: Realtor Referral Program

- [ ] **Design Realtor Referral Structure** - Establish formal referral program with clear commission structure or referral fees for real estate agents who refer clients.

- [ ] **Create Realtor Referral Page** - Build dedicated page explaining the program, benefits, and how real estate agents can participate.

- [ ] **Add Website Footer Link** - Add link to realtor referral program in website footer for easy access.

- [ ] **Promote to Local Real Estate Community** - Reach out to local real estate agents and brokerages to introduce the program.

## Phase 4: Trade Partner Relationships

- [ ] **Identify Potential Trade Partners** - Research local businesses that serve similar clientele and could benefit from mutual referrals. See [Trade Partners and Perks Guide](./01-trade-partners-and-perks.md) for examples and relationship-building strategies.

- [ ] **Develop Partnership Proposals** - Create mutually beneficial referral arrangements with local businesses. Consider offering client perks (discounts, special offers) while receiving referrals in return.

- [ ] **Establish Partnership Agreements** - Formalize relationships with clear expectations, referral processes, and benefit structures.

- [ ] **Promote Partner Perks to Clients** - Share partner discounts and special offers with clients as added value, reinforcing the partnership relationship.

## Phase 5: Strategic Promotions

- [ ] **Develop Bundle Strategy** - Instead of discounting services, create value bundles or bonus offerings that maintain perceived value. See [Bundles and Bonuses Guide](./02-bundles-and-bonuses.md) for strategic guidance.

- [ ] **Design Seasonal Promotions** - Plan promotional bundles or bonuses for peak seasons or slower periods to maintain consistent lead flow.

- [ ] **Promote Bundles Strategically** - Feature bundles and bonuses on website, in marketing materials, and during sales conversations.

## Ongoing Maintenance

- [ ] **Track Referral Sources** - Monitor which referral programs generate the most qualified leads and highest conversion rates.

- [ ] **Nurture Partner Relationships** - Regularly check in with trade partners, real estate agents, and community connections to maintain strong relationships.

- [ ] **Optimize Referral Programs** - Adjust incentives, messaging, and promotion strategies based on performance data and feedback.

- [ ] **Review Partnership ROI** - Evaluate the return on investment for each partnership and promotional initiative quarterly.
