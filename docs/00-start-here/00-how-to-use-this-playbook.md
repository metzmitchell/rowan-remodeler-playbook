## How to Work the Playbook

### Best Practices

**1. Stay focused on one section at a time**
- Don't bounce around randomly
- Complete a checklist before moving to the next

**2. Use checklists first, then drill into supporting docs**
- Every major section has a `00-[section]-checklist.md`
- Checklists give you the "what," docs give you the "how"

**3. Reference specific docs in your work**
- When assigning tasks, link to the exact playbook doc
- "Create blog post per [Big 5 Content](../05-content/16-answering-hard-questions.md#pricing-and-cost)"
- This ensures everyone follows the same process

**4. Add implementation notes**
- When you apply a strategy, note how you customized it for Semper Fi
- Helps future team members understand context

**5. Don't edit templates directly**
- Make client/project-specific copies
- Keep originals clean for reuse

**6. Update docs when you learn**
- If you discover a better way, update the playbook
- This is a living system, not static documentation

### Integration with Daily Work

**Don't treat the playbook as separate from work — it IS the work.**

- **Content creation?** Follow [Blog Content Strategy](../05-content/04-blog-content-strategy) and [AI workflows](../01-foundations/03-ai-in-marketing)
- **Sales call coming up?** Check [Discovery Questions](../07-sales-enablement/04-sales-discovery-questions-template) and [Assignment Selling](../07-sales-enablement/assignment-selling)
- **Setting up a campaign?** Start with [Paid Media Philosophy](../06-paid-media/00-paid-media-philosophy)
- **Client unhappy?** Reference [Client Experience](../02-trust-and-relationships/01-client-experience)
