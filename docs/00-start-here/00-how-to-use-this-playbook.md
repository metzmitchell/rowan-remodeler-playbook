# How to Use This Playbook

This is the front door. Use it to get everyone aligned before diving into the deeper sections.

## What’s inside
- **Foundations**: Beliefs and models that guide every recommendation.
- **Trust and relationships**: Referrals, partnerships, client experience, and reactivation.
- **Strategy**: Positioning, goals, and channel choices.
- **Digital presence**: Website standards, GBP, directory listings, and SEO fundamentals.
- **Content**: Voice, education, proof, email, social, and video.
- **Paid media**: Search, social, retargeting, and offline campaigns.
- **Sales enablement**: Discovery, objection handling, and sales content.
- **Systems and automation**: CRM, handoffs, automation, and recurring tasks.
- **Analytics**: KPIs, tracking, dashboards, and optimization.
- **Templates**: Ready-to-use assets grouped by use case.

## How to start
1) Run the **Marketing Readiness Assessment** to see where you stand.
2) Knock out **Quick Wins** for early momentum.
3) Set your **Point A and Point B** in `03-strategy/`.
4) Pick one priority from each of:
   - Trust/relationships
   - Digital presence
   - Content or proof
   - Systems/measurement

## How to work the playbook
- Stay in one section at a time; avoid bouncing around.
- Use checklists first, then the supporting docs.
- Drop links to the exact docs you’re using into your working notes so the team follows the same play.
- When something is context-heavy, add a short note on how you applied it. That keeps future readers grounded.
- Keep templates untouched; make client-specific copies elsewhere.

## When to come back here
- New client kickoff
- Quarterly resets
- Team onboarding
- After big strategy changes
