This checklist guides you through developing a comprehensive marketing strategy from initial vision through execution planning. Follow these steps in order to build a strategic foundation for marketing success.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Vision

- [ ] **Set Defined Goals** - Establish financial, measurable, and intangible goals for the marketing program. Define what success looks like in concrete terms.

- [ ] **Determine Top 3 Priorities** - Identify the three most critical priorities for the current phase. Focus on what moves the needle most.
