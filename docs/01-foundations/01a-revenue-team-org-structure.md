## Revenue Team Integration Points

### The Revenue Team Meeting (Sheridan Model)

**Frequency:** Bi-weekly  
**Attendees:** MM, Director, SM 

**Standing Agenda:**

| Topic | Owner | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Buyer questions & objections** | Director | Sales shares what prospects are asking → informs Big 5 content |
| **Content performance review** | SM/MM | What content is being used? What's working in Assignment Selling? |
| **Editorial calendar planning** | MM/SM | What content needs to be created? Who contributes? |
| **Pipeline & conversion review** | Director | Where are deals stalling? What friction points exist? |
| **Marketing metrics update** | MM | Lead volume, CAC, attribution insights |
| **Alignment action items** | MM | What does marketing need to do to make sales look great? |

**Sheridan's Warning:** "Companies get excited about the strategy but think they can skip the Revenue Team piece. Don't make this mistake."

### Assignment Selling Integration

> "Assignment Selling is the strategic practice of requiring prospects to consume specific educational content before sales conversations to improve close rates and reduce sales cycles."  
> — Marcus Sheridan

| Assignment Selling Element | Owner | Support |
|---------------------------|-------|---------|
| **Sales process definition** | Director | MM (review) |
| **Content-to-stage mapping** | MM | Director (input), SM (execution) |
| **Assignment Selling script** | Director | MM (review) |
| **Content library organization** | SM | Director (feedback on usability) |
| **Tracking compliance** | Director | MM (reporting) |
| **Results measurement** | MM | Director (data input) |

**The 3 Ws of Assignment Selling:**
1. **What** to assign (which content)
2. **When** to assign it (which stage)
3. **Why** it matters (how you communicate the importance)

**Content Library for Assignment Selling:**
- SM maintains organized, searchable content library
- Mapped to sales process stages
- Director ensures team knows how to find and use content
- MM tracks which content converts best

## Strategic Reasoning

### Why Revenue Team, Not Marketing Department

Per Marcus Sheridan: "Sales and marketing operating as separate islands is a losing strategy in today's market."

**Key Shifts:**
1. Marketing's north star is making the sales team look great, sound great, and win more deals
2. Sales shares buyer questions and objections weekly → informs content
3. Both teams share ownership of the entire buyer's journey
4. Regular Revenue Team meetings ensure alignment

### Why Assignment Selling is Central

- Buyers are 80% through their journey before reaching sales
- Assignment Selling shortens sales cycles and improves close rates
- Requires tight coordination between SM (content) and Director (execution)
- Content library must be organized and accessible for sales team

### Why Sales Participates in Content

Per Sheridan: "Your best content won't come from marketing alone—it comes from sales teams willing to serve as SMEs."

- Director and team contribute to content with SM
- Sales provides input on Big 5 content topics
- Content becomes more practical and usable in sales process
