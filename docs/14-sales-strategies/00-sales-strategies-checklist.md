# Sales Strategies Checklist

Establish a systematic approach to sales that tracks leads effectively, identifies competitive advantages, and maintains ongoing client relationships. Complete tasks in order to build a sustainable sales system.

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup

- [ ] **Set Up CRM System** - Configure CRM to track leads, store client details, and manage relationships. Store key information including where they heard about you, their goals, why they chose you, and how to make their experience exceptional. See [CRM Usage Guide](./01-crm-usage-guide.md) for strategic guidance.

- [ ] **Configure Calendly for Booking** - Set up Calendly Pro plan to enable conversion tracking in Google Analytics through redirect to thank you page. See [Calendly Configuration Guide](./02-calendly-configuration.md) for setup details.

## Phase 2: Initial Assessment

- [ ] **Perform Marketing Audit** - Conduct complete initial marketing audit or assessment to understand current state, identify gaps, and establish baseline metrics.

- [ ] **Identify Business Differentiators** - Document unique value propositions and competitive advantages that set your business apart. Focus on what makes you different and why clients should choose you.

- [ ] **Analyze Competitor Gaps** - Identify what competitors lack or do poorly. Use this analysis to refine sales positioning and emphasize areas where you excel.

## Phase 3: Sales Process Development

- [ ] **Develop Sales Discovery Questions** - Create and implement standard discovery questions to gather critical client information during sales conversations. See [Sales Discovery Questions Template](./03-sales-discovery-questions-template.md) for recommended questions to add to your CRM.

## Phase 4: Client Relationship Management

- [ ] **Conduct Client Experience Meetings** - Personally meet with recent clients to gather feedback, understand their experience, and identify opportunities to improve service delivery.

- [ ] **Implement Winback Campaign** - Set up system to re-engage past clients. In CRM, set reminders to follow up 6 months after clients quit, or batch send personalized messages every six months. See [Winback Campaign Strategy](./04-winback-campaign-strategy.md) for details.

- [ ] **Launch Raise the Dead Campaign** - Re-engage past leads who didn't convert. Set CRM reminders to follow up 6 months after marking leads as dead, or batch send personalized messages every six months. See [Raise the Dead Campaign Strategy](./05-raise-the-dead-campaign-strategy.md) for details.
