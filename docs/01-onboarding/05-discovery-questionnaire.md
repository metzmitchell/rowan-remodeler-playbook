# Discovery Questionnaire

**This is the full question bank.** Before we kick off, we’ll pare this down together based on your goals, service lines, and what we’re actually working on first.

Fill out what you can, mark **N/A** when something doesn’t apply, and note where you’re not sure.

If an answer differs by **service line**, **brand**, **location/market**, or **job type**, please answer separately.

---

## How to use this questionnaire

- **Be specific** where you can (numbers, examples, URLs, screenshots).
- **Attach documents** instead of rewriting them when possible.
- If you have multiple business lines (e.g., remodeling + handyman + restoration), answer each section for each line.

### Attach if available (optional but helpful)

- Latest P&L (last 12 months) + current year-to-date
- Basic capacity snapshot (crew count, subs, current backlog)
- Last 90 days of lead + sales data (even if it’s imperfect)
- Current price book / estimating templates / proposal templates
- Any marketing reports (SEO, ads, social, email)
