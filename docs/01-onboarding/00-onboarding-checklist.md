Complete onboarding tasks in order. Check off each item as you complete it.

## Pre-Engagement

- [ ] **Contract Signed** - Confirm the client contract has been signed before starting work.

- [ ] **Send First Invoice** - Issue the initial invoice and communicate payment terms. Note: Initial payment is due prior to engagement commencing. Recurring invoices are due by the first day of each month/period. Work will immediately pause due to late payments.

- [ ] **First Invoice Paid** - Verify initial payment has been received before commencing work.

## Discovery & Setup

- [ ] **Send Marketing Discovery Questionnaire** - Send the discovery questionnaire to the client. See [Discovery Questionnaire Template](/onboarding/discovery-questionnaire) for the full question bank.
