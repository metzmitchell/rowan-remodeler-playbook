# Onboarding Checklist

Complete onboarding tasks in order. Check off each item as you complete it.

## Pre-Engagement

- [ ] **Contract Signed** - Confirm the client contract has been signed before starting work.

- [ ] **Send First Invoice** - Issue the initial invoice and communicate payment terms. Note: Initial payment is due prior to engagement commencing. Recurring invoices are due by the first day of each month/period. Work will immediately pause due to late payments.

- [ ] **First Invoice Paid** - Verify initial payment has been received before commencing work.

## Discovery & Setup

- [ ] **Send Marketing Discovery Questionnaire** - Send the discovery questionnaire to the client. See [Discovery Questionnaire Template](./01-discovery-questionnaire.md) for the full question bank.

- [ ] **Discovery Questionnaire Completed** - Verify the client has completed and returned the discovery questionnaire.

- [ ] **Schedule Kick-Off Call** - Schedule the initial project kick-off meeting with the client.

- [ ] **Receive Admin Access** - Secure administrative access to all client marketing platforms. See [Admin Access Checklist](./02-admin-access-checklist.md) for detailed platform inventory and credential tracking.

- [ ] **Create File Storage System** - Set up shared folder structure in Google Drive (ideally in client's Google Drive) for marketing collaboration. See [File Storage System SOP](./03-file-storage-system-setup.md) for details.

- [ ] **Create Shared Working Documents** - Set up essential shared working documents (KPI sheets, strategy docs, call notes, login credentials, channel summary) in the shared folder. See [Shared Documents Checklist](./04-shared-documents-checklist.md) for details.

- [ ] **Join Client Slack** - Join the client's preferred communication platform (Slack, Teams, etc.) for project collaboration.
