    # How to ask AI about your situation
    
    Find a custom home builder
    
    - Enough website content - services listed
    - Some social content with copy
    
    Copy paste a bunch of their content
    
    Describe their company
    
    Make up some numbers
    
    Make up their demographic
    
    - Flight paths
    - Other sources of people moving there
    
    The overal story is that the true value comes from the critical thinking and the larger worldview and context that you bring. Not all the words and organization.
    
    Potential steps
    
    - Create that brand doc
    - Create a doc about your market placement
    - Include your goals, interests
    - Include marketing tactics you think would be fun, ideas you had
        - AI will probably skew towards agreeing with you
        - Doing things you like is super undervalued, because the biggest part is just benign consistent
    - Context length
        - A few pages
        - Keep it concise
        - Find out the character length for o1 preview
    
    Steps to create content:
    
    Find a builder with just a couple people at the company
    
    Go through this whole process for them as if it were your own company
    
    Business context doc
    
    - Have a generic outline
    - What am I using this for?
        - Ads
        - Create brand guidelines
        - Social media content
        - SEO
        - Create content for the website
            - Services pages, update about section, homepage, etc.
        - Brainstorm strategy
            - Will want to put some numbers into it
        - Keep the context window small. Take this document and condense it depending on what you use it for.
            - Give examples of that.
    - Have AI make or update the outline
    - Update the outline yourself
    - Split it into parts / append throughout the outline
        - Demographic
        - Services
        - Service areas
            - list out the exact areas
        - Business information
    - Context can’t be too huge. A lot of people use custom GPTs for this, which is fine, but I feel like you can make it concise enough and condense it into a useful context based on the use-case.
        - Maybe a custom GPT per each function (SEO, Accounting, business strategy, content)
        - Actually, yeah - do the custom GPT, because then you can have it create those smaller contexts for you. Also do in Anthropic
    
    Brand voice doc
    
    - Copy paste a whole bunch of brand copy
    
    Ad strategy doc
    
    Film myself doing it for a client or something, and talk through every step of the process
    
    Use an AI app
    
    What am I using it for?
    
    # Manually Written Steps
    
    Tell me about company
    
    - This should get a solid start about the company
    
    dive deeper on products and services.
    
    look through the website to see if there is any information that was missed in the initial “about” response
    
    you need to create an outline so that you can give 01 preview a structure to follow,  and then a whole bunch of context about the business.
    
    Once you have a some context,  generate an ideal outline
    
    - summarize the context for this first outline
    - you want to know about the business so that when you review the outline you can know what is important
    - provide a small amount of context for AI two reference while creating the outline
    - Create the outline of a document to provide context about a business.
        
        I will share some context below.  you can just create the outline and you don't need to go into detail.
        
        This document will be used to have ai generate things around marketing strategy, and to give a full inclusive perspective of the company.
        
    
    optimize the outline around your specific needs
    
    take that outline,  and the context,  and have AI  generate an output
    
    - look at what it has a tendency to do and adjust the context so that it's well-balanced
    
    once you have a good outline,  break into certain sections with extra detail.
    
    while creating these sections prompt to not include any generic suggestions or basic information assume I have a strong working knowledge of marketing and I only want things that are specific to this business that AI or a marketing professional wouldn't already assume
    
    Prompt for Demographic:
    
    Create a detailed demographic document.
    
    The document is for marketing professionals in the company, assume they already have a deep understanding of the company’s demographic.
    
    Don't include basic or generic suggestions, or generic assumptions about the demographic
    
    Focus on things that are unique and different and worth noting.
    
    Give specific geographic location for local design services, noting that there are also National services offered. One big location is Florida. A lot of people move up to Western North Carolina from Florida. A lot of people also move here from regions of the country where there are direct flights.
    
    Do not include competitor analysis
    
    Do not include marketing communication platforms or general marketing suggestions. Do not include future opportunities. Do not include citations.
    
    Prompt for services
    
    I actually had a hard time with this one. I wanted to include USP, specific things that make the company stand out, and details about the company. I took it from the overview doc that I initially had it create, then told it the prompt of what else to focus on.
    
    Prompt for Brand Voice:
    
    Create a brand info document. Reduce from the context that I give you. Outline the brand info document like this: tagline
    
    Short info about company
    
    Mission and philosophy
    
    Brand voice guidelines
    
    The brand voice guidelines do not need to be extensive
    
    Prompt for Keywords
    
    Give me keyword suggestions for this business. For SEO, SEM, and local SEO. Also include some recommendations to be prepared for GEO. I’ll include context, but you don’t need to follow it too much.
    
    The context was services, including USPs, and demographic - left out the parts about psychographic and people.

    3. **Develop an Outline**
