# Marketing Audit

## Goal
Perform a complete initial audit to understand the client's current status, assets, and gaps. This audit informs the strategy and roadmap.

## Process

1.  **Collect Assets**: Gather all available materials (website, social profiles, reviews, internal notes).
2.  **Generate Context**: Use the [Context Document Creation Prompt](./22-prompt-for-creating-context-documents.md) to turn these raw materials into a structured "Context Pack" for the AI.
3.  **Analyze Gaps**: Compare the current state against best practices and the client's goals.
