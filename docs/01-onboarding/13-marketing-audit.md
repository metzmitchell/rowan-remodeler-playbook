2.  **Generate Context**: Use the prompt below to turn these raw materials into a structured "Context Pack" for the AI.
3.  **Analyze Gaps**: Compare the current state against best practices and the client's goals.

# Prompt: Creating Remodeler Context Documents

[Context Doc Examples]([Your Drive Folder])

## Goal

Create a **context pack** for a specific **design-build remodeling company** so an AI can produce strategy, copy, ads, SEO content, and sales assets that sound like *this business*—not generic marketing advice.

## What to collect (inputs)

Paste only real source material (no guessing):

- **Website**: Home, About, Services pages, Process, Portfolio/Before–After, Financing (if any), FAQ, Contact
- **Google Business Profile**: description, categories, service area, hours, review highlights
- **Houzz** (if relevant): profile + reviews + awards/badges
- **Reviews**: 10–30 recent reviews (good + bad if available)
- **Social**: 10–20 recent captions/posts that sound like the company
- **Internal notes (if you have them)**: minimum project size, typical project range, service radius, current backlog, ideal projects, “not a fit” projects

## Remodeler-specific lens (how to organize the context)

A remodeler sells **transformation inside an occupied home**. Capture details that reduce the homeowner’s biggest fears:

- **Disruption** (dust/noise/living through it)
- **Surprises behind walls** (rot/wiring/structural issues)
- **Schedule drag**
- **Trust + professionalism** (crew behavior, daily cleanup, communication)

Also capture the remodeler “why us” angles:

- **Single-point accountability** (design-build)
- **A clear process** (design agreement → design → fixed scope/price → build)
- **Before/after proof**
- **Reviews that mention communication + cleanliness**

## Prompt 1 — Extract facts (no writing, no opinions)

Copy/paste into your AI:

---

You are a researcher building a context pack for a **design-build remodeling company**.

### Rules
- Use **only** the sources I paste.
- **Do not invent** facts, numbers, pricing, locations, or services.
- If something is unknown, write **Unknown** and list the **exact source** needed to confirm it.
- No generic marketing advice. No competitor analysis.

### Task
Extract and organize the facts into the structure below.

### Output structure
1) **Company snapshot**
- Name, HQ, service radius/service areas
- Team (roles, names if public), years in business, certifications/associations (NARI/NKBA/etc.), awards
- Positioning: who they help + what they’re known for (use their words)

2) **Services & project types**
- Core services (kitchens, baths, additions, whole-home, etc.)
- Ideal projects vs “not a fit”
- Any minimums, typical range cues, financing mentions

3) **Process (design-build)**
- How they describe the process step-by-step
- Preconstruction/design agreement details (if mentioned)
- What they do to prevent surprises (investigation, allowances, contingencies, communication)

4) **Proof & trust signals**
- Portfolio themes (styles, typical homes, common problems solved)
- Review themes with 5–10 short quoted snippets categorized under:
  - Communication
  - Cleanliness/respect for home
  - Craftsmanship
  - Budget/scope management
  - Schedule/timeliness

5) **Customer psychology (remodeler)**
- Common triggers (life events, outgrown space, remote work, aging parents, etc.) found in sources
- Top fears/objections implied by copy/reviews
- What reassures them (process, guarantees, policies, tools)

6) **Brand voice (from actual copy)**
- Voice adjectives (3–6)
- Do / Don’t list
- “Words we use” / “Words we avoid”
- 3 short example lines in their voice:
  - homepage subhead
  - Instagram caption
  - reply to a 5-star review

## Prompt 2 — Write the Master Context Doc (usable + concise)

Copy/paste into your AI after Prompt 1 output:

---

Using the extracted facts above, write a **Master Context Doc** for this remodeler.

### Audience
An experienced marketer who will create strategy, copy, ads, SEO pages, and sales assets.

### Constraints
- Be specific to this company; omit generic marketing advice.
- Keep it skimmable (headings + bullets). Target ~2–4 pages.
- Don’t add competitor research.
- Don’t invent details; keep Unknown items in a short **Open Questions** section.

### Sections
1) Company snapshot (1 paragraph + bullets)
2) Ideal customers + triggers (remodeler-specific)
3) Services + ideal projects
4) Process + “how they reduce disruption/surprises”
5) Differentiators + proof (reviews + portfolio themes)
6) Voice guidelines (short)
7) Core local keyword themes (project + city intent; cost/ROI; process/trust)
8) Offers/CTAs currently used (consultation, cost guide, etc.) + where they appear
9) Open Questions (only what’s truly missing)

## Optional — Split into smaller docs (if needed)

If you want separate, reusable docs, ask:

- “Split this into four standalone docs: (1) Company Snapshot + Positioning, (2) Buyer + Psychology, (3) Services + Process, (4) Brand Voice + Keyword Themes. Keep each under ~1 page.”
