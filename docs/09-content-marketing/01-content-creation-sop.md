# Content Creation SOP
15 minute max video (linkedin length limit)

- Youtube - good description - include link high in description
- Linkedin - write content custom, say link in comments
- Instagram - just upload the same thing as linkedin, but say link in bio, create reel thumbnail (4:5)
- Twitter - short tweet, with link to blog post
- Facebook - exactly same as linkedin
- Adding the link to the post is an option as well (whatever's easier)

### Example Lead Magnet Mini Campaign

## Standard Deliverables & Asset Specs

This list serves as a template for standardizing assets for campaigns and content.

| Deliverable | Specifications | Placement | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Brief** | See SOP |  |  |
| **Primary Graphic** | Square<br/>Export both:<br/>1000 x 1000 150-300kb JPG "web" in name<br/>2000 x 2000 medium size PNG "full-res" in name | Anywhere<br/>Carousel with inspo photos<br/>Social feed post<br/>Email blast | Title & main campaign branding |
| **Header Image** | 1500 x 700 if title only<br/>Can go up to 1500 x 1000 if details included<br/>JPEG, 150-300KB | Website Header, online & social calendar headers | Use large margins - will be used for online event listings with multiple formatting requirements |
| **Featured Image** | 800x700 px<br/>Similar to header image<br/>JPEG, 100-200kb | Thumbnail for website & online & social calendar listings<br/>Ticket "product" image for ecomm | No details, scalable |
| **Email Banner Ad** | 600 px width x190 px height<br/>PNG<br/>72 dpi<br/>The max file size is 1 MB |  | Include a CTA - something that looks like a button is fine. Examples here |
| **Very Short Description** | 70-150 characters |  |  |
| **Short Description** | 120-158 characters |  |  |
| **Long Description** | Longer than 200 characters | Website, | Use at least two subtitles, at least two sections, preferrably 3-5 |
| **Social post text** | Various options | Social | Include hashtags |
| **Primary Branding Social Post** | Same content, multiple formats<br/>Photo / graphic / carousel<br/>Video / animated <br/>.PNG , roughly 2000px, roughly 1-2mb files <br/>Export same content in ratios:<br/>Square, 4:5, 9x16 | Paid Social<br/>Organic Social feeds<br/>Organic Social Stories | If using a large budget for paid social, use multiple versions, post in one ad, turn on AI placements. Meta will choose format intuitively. Doesn't work with carousels - turn carousels into video<br/>9x16 version to keep important details in middle square to avoid title overlap |
| **Organic Social Content** | Whatever works. Always export 9x16 versions for stories |  |  |
| **Street Team Posters** | 11x17<br/>8.5x11<br/>4x9 |  | If street teaming, make all options. It's worth it. |
| **Postcard Mailer** | 8.5 x 5.5 |  |  |

- **Content Splintering**
    
    Receive Assets
    
    Create Blog Post
    
    - Use the graphic as the featured image. Include it in the post. Optimize the image before uploading
    - If there’s a Youtube video attached:
        - Put the youtube video near the top by copy pasting the link into the post
    - Copy google doc text into this tool: [https://saasytrends.com/gdoc-to-html](https://saasytrends.com/gdoc-to-html)
        - Then copy the text from there into the blog post (cleans up the HTML)
    - Use the thumbnail as the featured image (compress to WEBP first)
    
    Create Linkedin Post
    
    - Post between 6AM and 11pm EDT
    - Leave 5-10 comments on other people’s Linkedin content before posting
        - Make sure that the draft/notes from the “Post” document won’t be included in the Linkedin
        - Some contents on posts, but also respond to comments within the comments sections
        - Focus on AI, homebuilders, marketers
        - Make sure the comments are actually valuable and interact with the content and provide a unique perspective instead of just reiterating what was already said in the post or comments. Do not just go with the generic AI generated comment. Make it sound very realistic. Shorter than 2 paragraphs, longer than a few words.
        - These comments are very important and need to be high quality.
    
    Keep an eye out for responses to the post or other comments for a few minutes after the post goes live.
    
    More to come:
    
    Add to ongoing newsletter
    
    Post to Instagram
    
    Post to Youtube if video

    Stabilize and apply all effects
    
    Cut out blank spaces by clicking the transcribe tool on the timeline window
    
    Edit those cuts as needed

    **C1** is zebra levels
    
    - zebra custom level 1 is for highlights 90 to 100
    - zebra custom level 2 is for dark tones 10 to
    - 90 to 100 is bright white where you start losing details
    - skin tones are 50 to
    - 10 to 30 are dark tones where you start losing details
