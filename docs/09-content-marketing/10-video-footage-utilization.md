# Video Footage Utilization

**Here’s why and how to organize and utilize your video footage to get amazing results.**

## Summary

- **Why:** When you utilize your existing footage, your videos are much better. Most businesses just shoot all-new footage for every video. When you have a process, you can create more *and* better videos for the same effort.
- **Outline:**
    - **Standards:** Document & follow your footage standards and organization.
    - **Outsourcing:** Hire a good freelance editor who learns your footage because you stick with them for most everything.

## SOP

### Process
1. Shoot footage
2. Upload to cloud
3. Notify editor & receive edit
4. Editor saves any shots that can be used in other videos
5. Remove single-use footage from cloud

### Set Standards
- **Create an asset management file structure**
    - There are tons of ways to do this. Pick one, write it down & save it in the top-level footage folder.
    - Example folder structures:
        - `[Client Name] > interview / home tour / b-roll`
        - `Year > Month > Project Name`
    - There are asset management softwares, and AI will be making these more affordable. (IE: Search “interview about the pneumatic elevator”)
    - Store footage offline if you won’t use it again, otherwise it will eat up cloud storage pretty quickly.
- **Set standards for your video**
    - Your editor will be able to give you these guidelines.
    - What settings to use on your cell phone.
    - What settings to give videographers you hire.
        - You might need to connect the videographer and editor to discuss.

### Outsourcing

- Instead of the more common model of hiring a videographer to shoot, edit, and deliver a single file of the edited video, use an internal editor as much as possible.
- If you want your cell-phone videos to look more professional, send to the editor, and they’ll add video from your library, transitions, etc.
- Videographers will often edit their footage at a great rate. This is fine, just note the following:
    - Clarify that you’re receiving all the footage.
    - Have them follow your standards for footage/shooting settings and file organization.
    - The more you use the same editor, the more they memorize and utilize your best footage.
    - Great editing is like coding - a great editor can output 10x higher quality *and* quantity in the same amount of time as an average editor.
