# Referrals Checklist

Establish a systematic referral program that incentivizes past clients and partners to refer new business. Complete tasks in order to build a sustainable referral system that complements your reputation management and partnership strategies.

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup

- [ ] **Design Referral Program Structure** - Define referral incentives, terms, and eligibility. Determine what you'll offer (discount, gift card, cash, or service credit) and establish clear terms for when referrals convert to customers.

- [ ] **Set Up Referral Tracking System** - Establish method to track referrals (CRM tags, referral codes, or dedicated form). Ensure you can attribute new customers to their referrers.

## Phase 2: Website & Communication Integration

- [ ] **Create Referral Program Page** - Build dedicated referral program page on website explaining the program, incentives, and how to refer. Include clear call-to-action and contact information.

- [ ] **Add Referral Links to Website** - Link to referral program from key pages (footer, about page, contact page) and ensure it's easily discoverable.

- [ ] **Integrate into Email Communications** - Add referral program mention to email newsletters, email signatures, and post-project follow-up emails.

## Phase 3: Client Appreciation & Retention

- [ ] **Establish Client Gift Program** - Plan occasional small gifts (like holiday chocolates or project completion gifts) to show appreciation and improve retention. Determine appropriate occasions and gift types. See [Client Appreciation Gifts](./04-client-appreciation-gifts.md) for comprehensive gift strategies and budget guidelines.

- [ ] **Implement Client Gift Delivery** - Set up process for delivering client gifts at appropriate touchpoints (project completion, holidays, anniversary of project completion).

## Phase 4: Ongoing Promotion

- [ ] **Set Up Quarterly Referral Reminders** - Schedule quarterly email campaigns to existing clients reminding them about the referral program. See [Promote Referral Program](../08-systems-and-automation/recurring-tasks/02-referral-program-guide.md) for recurring task details.

- [ ] **Monitor Referral Performance** - Track referral sources, conversion rates, and ROI to optimize program effectiveness.
