PRD: Miro-style Playbook Board (Full UX)
Context
This repo is a Docusaurus site with docs served at the site root (routeBasePath: '/') and the sidebar autogenerated from the filesystem (sidebars.js uses { type: 'autogenerated', dirName: '.' }).
You want a page that looks like a Miro board / kanban:
Columns represent the main folder levels (ex: 01-onboarding).
Sections represent subfolders within a category.
Cards represent docs (markdown files).
The experience should feel like a “board” where you can quickly scan, open, and (optionally) curate a short list of tactics during a client call.
Problem statement
The playbook is easy to browse as a left-nav tree, but it’s hard to scan at a glance like a “tactics menu” during a call. A board layout makes it faster to:

see categories side-by-side
see what’s inside each category without drilling down
navigate directly to a tactic/SOP
Goals
Board view that renders as a horizontally scrollable set of columns.
Fast navigation + scanning: see what exists, open docs quickly, return to the board without losing your place.
Call-friendly curation: optionally allow selecting a set of tactics (without a backend) to build a “menu” for a client conversation.
No extra content maintenance by default: automatically follows the folder structure (good for AI to generate/maintain).
Deterministic mapping from folder tree → UI, so changes to docs predictably change the board.
Static-site compatible: works on the built site with no backend.
Non-goals
Multi-user syncing.
Editing content files from the UI (moving docs across folders in git).
“True Miro” freeform canvas (this is a structured board UI).
Replacing the docs sidebar; this is an additional view.
Primary users
[Advisor] (operator): uses the board during client calls to quickly jump into tactics.
AI-assisted maintenance: AI can create/move docs and the board updates automatically.
Scope
Board visualizes the main playbook categories (ex: 01-onboarding, 02-systems-and-organization, etc.). In the current repo layout these live at the top level of docs/.
If/when the site is reorganized so playbook content lives under docs/playbook/, the board can be trivially re-scoped to that subtree by changing the filter root (no UI rewrite).
UX / IA requirements
Route: a dedicated page such as /board (implemented as a React page under src/pages/).
Layout primitives
Board canvas: horizontal scroll, columns have fixed width; board preserves scroll position on return navigation.
Column: category (ex: 01-onboarding).
Section: subfolder (nested category) within a column.
Card: doc item.
Global board header (top bar)
Search: filter cards by title (and optionally description).
Filters (optional):
by tag (if tags exist in frontmatter)
by “type” (tactic vs SOP vs template) if such metadata exists
View toggles:
compact vs comfortable cards
show/hide descriptions
Counts: show “X columns / Y docs shown” for confidence.
Card interactions (core UX)
Open: click card opens the doc (same tab).
Peek (optional): hover or “space/enter” opens a right-side preview drawer showing:
title, description, first ~10 lines, and key links
actions: “Open full doc”, “Copy link”
Copy link: one-click copy permalink (use browser clipboard API).
Doc page integration (optional, but improves “full UX”)
Add an always-available Back to board affordance (link/button) that returns to /board and restores:
board scroll position
current filters/search
currently selected items (if selection exists)
“Selection tray” (recommended for call UX; no backend)
Purpose: during a call, you can pick tactics and end with a short “today’s menu”.

Select: star/checkbox icon on each card.
Tray: a collapsible panel (right or bottom) listing selected cards.
Reorder selected: drag reorder inside the tray (this is isolated and simple).
Share: encode selected ids into the URL (querystring) so you can copy/paste a shareable link.
Export (optional): copy a markdown list of selected tactics (links) to clipboard.
Drag and drop (optional; purely UI)
To keep it “Miro-like” without breaking the static-site model:

Allow drag reordering cards within a section as a client-only preference (does not change docs order in git).
Persist ordering in localStorage keyed by board version (optional).
Accessibility & keyboard UX
Tab navigation between interactive elements (search, filters, cards).
Keyboard shortcuts (optional):
/ focus search
Esc close preview drawer
Enter open card
S toggle select on focused card
Ensure headings are semantic (h1 page title, h2 column, h3 section).
Data source + mapping rules (keep it simple)
Use Docusaurus’ docs client data rather than reading the filesystem at runtime.

Recommended source
Use useAllDocsData from @docusaurus/plugin-content-docs/client to access the resolved sidebar items tree (after type: 'autogenerated' is expanded) plus doc metadata (titles, permalinks).
This is an officially supported extension point: sidebars are a tree of sidebar item types (category, doc, ref, link, etc.), and autogenerated sidebars are resolved into that same tree at build time. Docs hooks let you consume that resolved structure in custom UI pages.

Practical access pattern (robust to minor version differences)
Identify the docs plugin id (commonly default) from Object.keys(useAllDocsData()).
Identify the sidebar id from your sidebars.js (in this repo it is tutorialSidebar).
Retrieve sidebar items from either:
`allDocsData[pluginId].versions[0].sidebars[sidebarId]` (common shape)
or `allDocsData[pluginId].sidebars[sidebarId] (some shapes expose `sidebars at the plugin root)
Implementation should probe these paths once (during dev) and standardize on the one that exists for this site.

Filtering to playbook categories
We’ll traverse the returned sidebar items and keep only items that represent the playbook categories.

Primary filter (current repo layout): include top-level categories matching the numeric-prefix convention ^\\d\\d- (ex: 01-onboarding).

Alternate filter (future layout): if the sidebar yields a category named playbook, use it as the root, otherwise filter by doc/permalink prefix (ex: /playbook/).

Mapping to board model
Column: each category directly under the board root (ex: 01-onboarding, 02-systems-and-organization).
Section: nested categories under a column.
Card: doc items.
Docs directly under a column (not in a subfolder) go into an implicit section like Core.
Optional metadata (AI-friendly, but not required)
If present, consume:

Doc front matter:
title, description (already supported)
tags (if used)
optional future: docType, estimatedEffort, status
Category metadata (if introduced later):
prefer Docusaurus-supported mechanisms (sidebar category definitions / generated indexes)
treat _category_.json as useful for label/order/linking, but do not depend on non-guaranteed fields unless we verify they flow through the sidebar items we read at runtime.
Label normalization
Display-friendly label from folder names:
strip numeric prefixes: ^\d+-
replace dashes with spaces
preserve original casing when frontmatter provides a title
“Good for AI” considerations
Single source of truth: folder/doc structure. No separate board config file required.
Deterministic output: same inputs produce same board.
Machine-readable hooks (optional but low-effort): add data-* attributes on rendered elements:
data-doc-id, data-permalink
data-category-label, data-category-path
This makes it easier for automated tools/AI to parse the board DOM.

No fragile heuristics: avoid hardcoding category names beyond the board root filter.
Technical approach (Docusaurus)
Add a React page:
`[...]/src/pages/board/index.js (or `board.js) renders the board.
Add a small presentational component:
`[...]/src/components/PlaybookBoard/` (optional; can keep everything in the page if you want maximum simplicity).
Styling:
Prefer a CSS module for the page or component.

Client-only state model (for “full UX”)
All state is optional; the board should still work if state is disabled.

URL state (shareable):
search query
selected doc ids (for call curation)
active filters (tags/types)
localStorage state (per-user convenience):
last board scroll position
last used filters
optional: custom ordering preferences for cards/sections
updates
optional persist
open
back link preserves
User
Board UI
URL query params
localStorage
Doc page
Phased rollout (keeps it simple but complete)
Phase 1 (must-have): board layout + card links + search + preserved scroll on back.
Phase 2 (call UX): selection tray + shareable URL + copy markdown export.
Phase 3 (power UX): preview drawer + optional drag reorder (local-only) + tag filters.
Acceptance criteria
/board exists and renders on both dev and production builds.
Columns reflect the playbook category folders in the correct order (ex: docs/01-onboarding, docs/02-systems-and-organization, etc.).
Each card links to the correct doc page.
Search filters visible cards correctly.
Returning from a doc to the board restores board position (and preserves filters if used).
If Phase 2 is implemented: selected tray state is preserved via URL (shareable).
Works with the existing config:
docusaurus.config.js uses docs at / and sidebars.js is autogenerated.
Risks / edge cases
Current repo state: many playbook docs appear deleted/moved in git status; the board will mirror whatever is actually present.
Autogenerated sidebar may sometimes produce unexpected nesting if there are index files; mapping rules should handle:
empty categories
categories with only an index doc
deep nesting
Board scale: if there are hundreds of cards, consider lightweight rendering optimizations (but likely not needed here).
Validation notes
Perplexity MCP is available in this workspace as perplexity_ask (Sonar API). It validated that the simplest supported approach is:
build a custom React page under src/pages/
use docs client hooks (notably useAllDocsData, optionally useDocsSidebar/useDoc) to access the resolved sidebar items tree
traverse category/doc items to render custom UI.
Relevant Docusaurus docs:

Sidebar overview: https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar
Sidebar item types + metadata/customProps: https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar/items
Autogenerated sidebars: https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar/autogenerated
Implementation notes (when implementing)
Start by prototyping the traversal of useAllDocsData() to:
locate the playbook root (numeric-prefix categories, or playbook subtree if present)
print/inspect the item shapes (category/doc) during dev
Then implement the board renderer and CSS.
Open questions (intentionally deferred)
Whether you want a second board scoped to all docs/ later.
Whether you want completion state later (localStorage/frontmatter).
