# Rowan Marketing Playbook — Organization PRD

*A living knowledge base for builder and remodeler marketing*

---

## What This Playbook Is

**Your proprietary marketing thinking, made shareable.**

This playbook captures how you think about marketing for builders and remodelers—not just what to do, but why it works and when to use it. It's designed to:

1. **Share with clients** — Give them real insight into your approach
2. **Train team members** — Document your thinking so others can execute
3. **Build your body of work** — Accumulate knowledge over time
4. **Differentiate your practice** — Your methods are your moat

**Core positioning this playbook reflects:**
> "I help builders and remodelers get projects more consistently than referrals and with more transparency than an agency"

---

## Guiding Principles

These shape both the content and structure:

### From Your Marketing Philosophy
- **Trust-critical environment** — One wrong move hurts the brand. Reputation is everything.
- **Relationships over reach** — 1-to-1 and in-person interactions over mass marketing
- **Build in-house, not dependency** — Help clients graduate from referrals without becoming agency-dependent
- **Transparency as strategy** — No markup games, no hidden agendas
- **Conservative approach** — High-stakes industry requires measured decisions

### From Kevin's Advisory Model
- **Own the problem** — Think like a general contractor of marketing, not a task-taker
- **Point A to Point B** — Define where they are, where they want to be, build the bridge
- **Business outcomes over deliverables** — You're paid for results, not activities
- **Separate strategy from execution** — Remain objective by not marking up implementation
- **Specialize to advise** — Deep niche expertise enables strategic consulting

### Integration Points
- **They Ask, You Answer** — Answer customer questions honestly (especially pricing, problems, comparisons)
- **Give before you ask** — Provide value consistently before asking for anything
- **Document, don't create** — Share your real work and thinking, not polished perfection
- **Performance creative** — Test to find winners, then scale what works (Gary V)

## What Belongs Here vs. Elsewhere

| In This Playbook | Separate (Internal Operations) |
|------------------|--------------------------------|
| Marketing philosophy and beliefs | How Rowan specifically onboards clients |
| Frameworks for how to think | Internal file storage structure |
| Strategy templates and checklists | Admin access tracking spreadsheets |
| Best practices and standards | Offboarding procedures |
| Client-shareable guides | Tool-specific configurations |
| AI prompts and workflows | Project management workflows |

**Rule of thumb:** If it explains *how to think about marketing*, it stays. If it's *how Rowan runs operations*, it moves out.

---

## Sorting Rule: Digital Presence vs. Content

**Digital Presence** = How the platform works
- Structure, UX, SEO, conversion optimization, accuracy, speed, technical setup

**Content** = What you say/show
- Ideas, stories, education, proof, scripts, thought leadership, voice

*Example: Website design standards → Digital Presence. Blog post topics → Content.*

## Section Purposes

### 00-start-here
**Entry point for new clients.** Quick orientation, self-assessment to know where to start, immediate quick wins. This is the "front door" of the playbook.

### 01-foundations
**The "why" behind everything.** Your beliefs about marketing, why builders are different, the revenue team model, AI's role. This is what makes the playbook *yours*.

### 02-trust-and-relationships
**The heart of builder marketing.** Your entire value proposition centers on trust-critical, relationship-driven marketing. Clients need to believe relationships win before diving into tactics.

### 03-strategy
**Planning, positioning, and goal-setting.** Where are you, where do you want to be, who are you talking to, what channels make sense. **Includes positioning and differentiation** — where you stand and why you're different.

### 04-digital-presence
**How platforms work.** Website structure, UX, SEO, conversion optimization, technical performance. The mechanics that need to be right.

### 05-content
**What you say/show.** Voice, tone, ideas, stories, education, proof. **Includes buyer-resources** — tools for prospects while they shop. **Includes proof-and-credibility** — portfolio, testimonials, client stories, awards, reviews.

### 06-paid-media
**Advertising and performance marketing.** Paid channels for generating qualified leads. **Includes performance creative** — testing and scaling winners.

### 07-sales-enablement
**Helping salespeople close.** Discovery, sales content, objection handling, proposals.

### 08-systems-and-automation
**Infrastructure, tools, and automated workflows.** CRM, lead qualification, handoffs, recurring tasks, tools. **Includes automation** — email sequences, lead nurturing, personalization at scale, chatbots, trigger-based workflows.

### 09-analytics
**Measuring what matters.** KPIs tied to revenue, not vanity metrics. Tracking, dashboards, knowing what you can afford.

---

## Design Principles for Content

### Voice
- Direct, practical, opinionated
- First-person when expressing beliefs ("I believe...")
- Explain the *why*, not just the *what*
- Real examples from builder/remodeler context

### Structure
- Lead with "why this matters"
- Include "how to think about this" before "what to do"
- Link to related content
- Keep it scannable

### AI Integration
- Include AI prompts where relevant
- Note when AI accelerates a process
- Maintain human judgment for trust-critical decisions
- Document human-AI hybrid workflows

### Extensibility
- Each section can grow independently
- New topics can be added without restructuring
- Templates separate from concepts
- Cross-references over duplication

---

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Structure (Week 1)
- [ ] Create new folder structure
- [ ] Create all index.mdx files
- [ ] Write 00-start-here content (entry point priority)
- [ ] Move files to new locations (rough mapping)

### Phase 2: Consolidation (Week 2)
- [ ] Merge duplicate content
- [ ] Delete duplicates
- [ ] Fix internal links
- [ ] Move internal SOPs to separate folder

### Phase 3: New Content (Weeks 3-4)
- [ ] Write missing foundation docs
- [ ] Build out 05-content/buyer-resources
- [ ] Build out 08-systems-and-automation/automation

### Phase 4: Polish (Ongoing)
- [ ] Add AI prompts throughout
- [ ] Expand thin content
- [ ] Review and update templates

---

## Open Questions

1. **Naming:** "Rowan Marketing Playbook" or "Builder Marketing Playbook"?
2. **Internal ops location:** `/internal-operations/` sibling folder or completely separate?
3. **Client access:** Full playbook or curated "client edition"?
4. **Platform:** Continue with Docusaurus or consider alternatives?
